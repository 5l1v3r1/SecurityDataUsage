This technology will support seamless acceleration of virtually any graph API (e.g., STINGER, Neo4j, GraphLab, Spark, OrientDB), and will take advantage of a variety of underlying hardware systems, including multi-core CPUs, GPUs, MICs, FPGA systems, or any combination of these. During the initial phase of the project we will develop a proof-of-concept prototype that will demonstrate the technologyÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to provide orders-of-magnitude acceleration for graph analytics.

Despite heavy investments in security and cyber defense, the sheer ubiquity and interconnectedness of DoD equipment leave open the possibility of intrusion through a myriad of means including advanced persistent threats (APTs).  Such threats take many forms, such as Trojans, back-doors in embedded systems, worms, spear-phishing, and viruses, all of which could prove detrimental to the war-fighter if not discovered. Recent examples of such advanced attacks include Stuxnet and Flame.   Detecting such threats requires novel techniques that are not signature based, since such attacks (or, at the very least, the most dangerous ones) are often customized for a particular target, perhaps based upon substantial intelligence gathering.Accordingly, we intend to use the SKAION 2009 DARPA Dataset to test our novel anomaly detection algorithms.  This data set will provide both background ""signal"" into which we can inject our own anomalous measurements, as well as providing a data set with its own inherent anomalies.  Our main computational tools will be advanced ideas from multi-sensor fusion, compressed sensing, and dependency analysis.This work is currently being funded by the Office of the Secretary of Defense under contract #W911QX-13-C-0015.",0,NULL,NULL,303,DARPA Scalable Network Monitoring (SNM) Program Traffic,DARPA,338,Randy ,Paffenroth,United States,Numerica Corporation,United States,Commercial3303,6/21/13,Approved,7/8/13,Migrated DS,"Russell Williams, russellw@signalsense.comMegan Hazen, megan@signalsense.comBoth of the above are at:SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA2069793622","SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA",The data will be used to evaluate unsupervised machine learning approaches to identifying anomalous traffic.,0,NULL,NULL,183,Skaion 2006 IARPA Dataset,SKAION,506,Alan,McIntyre,United States,SignalSense,United States,Commercial3304,6/21/13,Approved,7/8/13,Migrated DS,"Russell Williams, russellw@signalsense.comMegan Hazen, megan@signalsense.comBoth of the above are at:SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA2069793622","SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA",The data will be used to evaluate unsupervised machine learning approaches to identifying anomalous traffic.,0,NULL,NULL,303,DARPA Scalable Network Monitoring (SNM) Program Traffic,DARPA,506,Alan,McIntyre,United States,SignalSense,United States,Commercial3305,6/21/13,Approved,7/8/13,Migrated DS,"Russell Williams, russellw@signalsense.comMegan Hazen, megan@signalsense.comBoth of the above are at:SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA2069793622","SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA",The data will be used to evaluate unsupervised machine learning approaches to identifying anomalous traffic.,0,NULL,NULL,359,NCCDC 2008,Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (UTSA/CIAS),506,Alan,McIntyre,United States,SignalSense,United States,Commercial3306,6/21/13,Approved,7/8/13,Migrated DS,"Russell Williams, russellw@signalsense.comMegan Hazen, megan@signalsense.comBoth of the above are at:SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA2069793622","SignalSense, Inc.811 1st Ave Suite 480Seattle, WA 98104USA",The data will be used to evaluate unsupervised machine learning approaches to identifying anomalous traffic.,0,NULL,NULL,360,NCCDC 2011,Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (UTSA/CIAS),506,Alan,McIntyre,United States,SignalSense,United States,Commercial3301,6/21/13,Approved,8/12/13,Migrated DS,"Dr. Philip Du Toit Numerica Corporation 4850 Hahns Peak Drive, Suite 200 Loveland, CO 80538 USA 970-461-2000 philip.dutoit@numerica.us  Dr. Ryan Nong Numerica Corporation 70 South Lake Avenue, Suite 1000 Pasadena, CA 91101 USA 970-461-2000 ryan.nong@numerica.us  Dr. Louis Scharf Research Professor Department of Mathematics Colorado State University 126 Weber Building Fort Collins, CO 80523 USA (970) 491-6792 scharf@engr.colostate.edu   Prof. Anura P.
