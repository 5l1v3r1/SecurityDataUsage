Compared to the existing Internet topology measurement platforms, the system will (i) build Internet topology graphs with higher accuracy as the system integrates several mechanisms to efficiently handle large-scale measurement data; (ii) work at higher level of granularity by providing backbone topology maps at link layer; (iii) periodically release annotated network topologies in addition to the raw measurement data so that the community can utilize them in their experiments and optimize network communications; (iv) help in understanding Internet topology dynamics and providing network enhancements; and (v) provide a graph indexing tool to process and analyze large-scale networks.In particular, we will be using the IP addresses discovered(actively responding to the ICMP calls) in this dataset as feed to our probing system to further expand our target range in our  measurement campaign.Web Page of our project can be found in this link: im.cse.unr.edu",1,National Science Foundation,Darleen L.

( greater than 1TB).Dataset Choice (Why this data set?):The best penetration testers/researchers in industry, and the best security minded college students are competing against each other.  This presents a rare opportunity to analyze Ã¢Â€Âœsecurity principles in practice.Ã¢Â€ÂSince there are multiple teams, each team presents discrete sets of data for analysis of security principles.  Thus we potentially get multiple data points.Since the data is captured from a cyber competition there is a guarantee of ""malicious"" traffic, and this guarantee presents with a data set against which our goals, questions, tools, and potential solutions can be tested.The data set has clear start and finish times, and is relatively short in duration (two days), but is saturated with different types of ""malicious traffic.""The data set is as close to a standard model as a researcher may find ""in the wild.""  That is, the strict rules governing red/blue team actions, and the same equipment/scenarios across multiple teams creates a fairly standardized model from which to conduct research.Final Goal:Create training slides (based on the above statements) for our student members.Thank you,Jose David Mireles",0,NULL,NULL,519,NCCDC 2015,Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (UTSA/CIAS),1440,Jose,Mireles,United States,Computer Security Association,United States,Academia4702,12/1/15,Approved,12/2/15,Migrated DS,,"2026 Wisper Woods Way , Windsor Mill, Maryland 21244",Review of prior year's competition,0,NULL,NULL,519,NCCDC 2015,Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (UTSA/CIAS),937,Julio,Valcarcel,United States,"University of Maryland, Baltimore County (2)",United States,Academia4698,11/25/15,Approved,11/30/15,Migrated DS,,"3301 College Avenue , Fort Lauderdale, , Florida 33314","We are developing a new method of increasing the efficiency of intrusion detection systems.

Students will acquire access to the Synthetically Generated Data which are generated in a synthetic environment, where benign user activity and malicious attacks are emulated by computer programs. This data includes full network packets, firewall logs, application logs, and malicious attacks. The students will use two subcategories of datasets: (1) Synthetic Cyber Exercise Data which represents traffic from a cyber-defense competition based on a typical small company network configuration of 50+ users, 7-10 servers, and common Internet services such as web server, mail server, and e-commerce site. Traffic generators continuously feed simulated user traffic into the network as users handle business requests and detect and respond to threats.(2) Synthetic Mixed Traffic from Scalable Network Monitoring Program, which include synthetic HTTP, SMTP, and DNS background data. The attacks are large scale network attacks including DNS worms, http worms, and DDoS attacks. The worms and DDoS attacks have been parameterized to exhibit various propagation characteristics. The students will understand the data format, structure, and domain knowledge. They will pre-process the collected data to make them available for further analysis, for example, turning strings of text into information that can be indexed, stored, managed and searched automatically. Component Two: Real-time security assessment Students will process and analyze the collected security data from PREDICT, such as network packets, firewall logs, application logs, etc. for security assessment intelligence processing for the network. The students will combine network traffic and logs from multiple sources and correlate events together to create real-time alerts of abnormal traffic such as distributed denial of service attack, port scans, or worm outbreaks. Catching a hacker and being able to stop them while the attack is taking place is more useful than being able to use forensics to piece together an attack that already took place. The students will apply statistical methods and data mining techniques to analyze the datasets. The real-time evaluation requires fast data retrieval, fast storage, fast processing, and fast reporting. The students will investigate the possibility of improving process speed for big data processing and analysis through optimization, parallel computing, as well as utilizing tools such as Hadoop and MapReuce for BDA, etc. Component Three: Managing and reporting results The students will develop a software system Ã¢Â€ÂœReal-time Security Assessment DashboardÃ¢Â€Â for system administrators or security analysts to monitor the real-time security assessment results and alerts using a component-based development method. This component provides a graphic user interface for the user to see interactive reports and visualizations of security assessment results. The students will investigate how to best communicate the data analysis results to the user to support intelligent decision making to protect the security of the network. Description: Students will utilize the data repository provided by the PREDICT This course will scrutinize, evaluate and utilize data repository provided by PREDICT (Protected Repository of the Defense of Infrastructure against Cyber threats).

We attempt to transform theincoming stream of low-level data to a high-level understanding of thenetworkÃ¢Â€Â™s operational status and reach actionable recommendations. EachNetFlow record includes some basic information about the sampled flow,including its source and destination address, duration, size, etc. Anindividual NetFlow record cannot give us much information about whathappens in the network. Therefore, instead of trying to understand whathappens at the level of individual flows, we focus our analysis on thelevel of aggregated flows. Aggregation will not be Ã¢Â€ÂœhardwiredÃ¢Â€Â, e.g.,based on fixed prefix resolution. Instead, we will propose a clusteringalgorithm for flow aggregation that selects automatically the set offeatures that produce the most homogeneous clusters of NetFlow records.We will utilize spatio-temporal information of the NetFlow dataset torefine clusters to a meaningful homogeneous level. For example, a goodcluster of NetFlow records may end up being all NetFlix traffic thatoriginates from a certain Limelight caching site in Atlanta to allComcast customers in Macon GA during a 6-hour time period.After the clustering step is performed, the next task will be toidentify significant correlations between clusters.Temporal correlationsof these clusters are leveraged to form a graphical model between them.The graphical model with nodes being clusters of flows and edges beingtemporal correlations between them offers parsimonious model of networkdynamics. We will use this model to monitor the network for behavioralshifts and anomalies, which can be proxies for security attacks, networkproblems, structural changes or real changes in the behavior of thenetwork subscribers.",0,NULL,NULL,154,Departmental-Netflow-Trace-1,"Merit Network, Inc.",965,kamal,shadi,United States,Georgia Institute of Technology (4),United States,Academia4314,6/18/15,Approved,6/18/15,Migrated DS,,"2414 Hannon Street , Hyattsville, Maryland 20783",determine the effectiveness of determine infiltration and ex-filtration of malicious attitudes. ,0,NULL,NULL,433,Historical GT Malware Passive DNS Data 2011-2013,Georgia Tech,956,Tevin,Dixon,United States,Morgan State University (1),United States,Academia4303,5/14/15,Approved,1/14/16,Migrated DS,"Hao Ding, PhD StudentUniversity of Science and Technology BeijingChinaEmail: haoding8724@gmail.com","Case Western Reserve UniversityEECS Department10900 Euclid AvenueCleveland, OH 44106-7071U.S.A.","Our project involves studying various characteristics of real Internet traffic.

After all, many safety interventions Ã¢Â€Â“ like cancer screenings or keeping computer software up-to-date Ã¢Â€Â“ depend on the participation of the public for success.      There have been numerous studies on the relationship between actuarial risk and risk perception. It is well documented that risk perception and actuarial risk are not often aligned. For example, people perceive risks they dread or take involuntarily as more severe than others, so that skiing or plastic surgery are experienced as much less risky than they actually are.      For cyber security, the relationship between risk perception and actuarial risk is much less well studied. Most studies investigate how risk perception impacts behavior, e.g., to bank and shop online.     This study would shed light on the origins of risk perceptions rather than its consequences by combining data on actuarial risk with data from risk perception surveys in several countries. The PREDICT database would provide data on the actuarial risk, i.e., the frequency of various types of cyber-attacks. A simple regression analysis would reveal, whether people in countries suffering more attacks or in countries from which more attacks originate are more concerned about cybersecurity.     If there is a large gap between actuarial risk and risk perception Ã¢Â€Â” i.e., if people feel safe when they should not-, policy to manage cyber risk perception and to boost participation by the public in keeping computer systems safe is urgently needed. If there is no such gap, policymakers should try to benefit from the publicÃ¢Â€Â™s awareness in order to develop cost-efficient cyber risk management efforts.  ",0,NULL,NULL,261,DSHIELD Logs,University of Wisconsin,778,Frauke,Hoss,United States,Harvard Kennedy School (2),United States,Academia3722,9/17/14,Approved,9/17/14,Migrated DS,,"13320 Manor Stone Drive , Germantown, Maryland 20874",C3E challenge problem,0,NULL,NULL,433,Historical GT Malware Passive DNS Data 2011-2013,Georgia Tech,694,Nick,Carey,United States,Johns Hopkins University (2),United States,Academia3720,9/15/14,Approved,9/15/14,Migrated DS,,"2475 ROBB DR APT 1037, RENO, Nevada 89523",The motivation of the project is to develop a comprehensive system that will capture the Internet topology at fine granularity and periodically provide snapshots of the Internet backbone.

Students will acquire access to the Synthetically Generated Data which are generated in a synthetic environment, where benign user activity and malicious attacks are emulated by computer programs. This data includes full network packets, firewall logs, application logs, and malicious attacks. The students will use two subcategories of datasets: (1) Synthetic Cyber Exercise Data which represents traffic from a cyber-defense competition based on a typical small company network configuration of 50+ users, 7-10 servers, and common Internet services such as web server, mail server, and e-commerce site. Traffic generators continuously feed simulated user traffic into the network as users handle business requests and detect and respond to threats.(2) Synthetic Mixed Traffic from Scalable Network Monitoring Program, which include synthetic HTTP, SMTP, and DNS background data. The attacks are large scale network attacks including DNS worms, http worms, and DDoS attacks. The worms and DDoS attacks have been parameterized to exhibit various propagation characteristics. The students will understand the data format, structure, and domain knowledge. They will pre-process the collected data to make them available for further analysis, for example, turning strings of text into information that can be indexed, stored, managed and searched automatically. Component Two: Real-time security assessmentStudents will process and analyze the collected security data from PREDICT, such as network packets, firewall logs, application logs, etc. for security assessment intelligence processing for the network. The students will combine network traffic and logs from multiple sources and correlate events together to create real-time alerts of abnormal traffic such as distributed denial of service attack, port scans, or worm outbreaks. Catching a hacker and being able to stop them while the attack is taking place is more useful than being able to use forensics to piece together an attack that already took place. The students will apply statistical methods and data mining techniques to analyze the datasets. The real-time evaluation requires fast data retrieval, fast storage, fast processing, and fast reporting. The students will investigate the possibility of improving process speed for big data processing and analysis through optimization, parallel computing, as well as utilizing tools such as Hadoop and MapReuce for BDA, etc. Component Three: Managing and reporting resultsThe students will develop a software system Ã¢Â€ÂœReal-time Security Assessment DashboardÃ¢Â€Â for system administrators or security analysts to monitor the real-time security assessment results and alerts using a component-based development method. This component provides a graphic user interface for the user to see interactive reports and visualizations of security assessment results. The students will investigate how to best communicate the data analysis results to the user to support intelligent decision making to protect the security of the network. Description: Students will utilize the data repository provided by the PREDICT This course will scrutinize, evaluate and utilize data repository provided by PREDICT (Protected Repository of the Defense of Infrastructure against Cyber threats). From the website: www.predict.org. Also PREDICT provides qualified evaluators and developers with continually updated network operation data that they are able to utilize in their cyber security research.

Yet, the security of firewalls depends on the quality of protection obtained by the firewall policy hardening.The lack of metrics and attack incident data make measuring the security of firewall policies a challenging task. This requires defining a set of objective metrics to measure and to compare quality of protection of firewall policies objectively.This research project intends to propose a new set of quantitative metrics that can be used to measure and to compare the security level of firewall policies in an enterprise network. The presented metrics should be proven to be (1) valid as compared with the ground truth, and (2) practically useful as each one implies actionable security hardening.

With this data, I intend to use Econometric techniques to explain two features of internet use (the field of Econometrics is a specialty in Economics, where the econometrician applies advanced statistics to economic problems).  One, I can describe and explain the time series properties of internet use and disruptions to that use.  Understanding the time series properties of the data is fundamental to understanding how the phenomenon evolves and further understanding what might affect or disrupt internet traffic.  An analogy from economics in general would be Gross Domestic Product in the United States.  Econometricians take great pains to explain the time series properties of gross domestic product in order to understand how the long run trend changes over time and how the economy fluctuates around that trend.  My project is based on the premise that understanding how internet use evolves over time is important to explaining how policy makers may or may not be able to predict when a disruption will occur, just as economists attempt to predict when a recession might occur in the economy at large. The second feature of internet use that PREDICT data may allow me to explore is the cross-country characteristics of internet use (note, data collected both over space and time is known as Ã¢Â€Âœpanel dataÃ¢Â€Â to econometricians, or Ã¢Â€Âœlongitudinal dataÃ¢Â€Â in the social sciences more broadly).  Understanding how internet use has spread across countries over time may also be important for understanding the policy implications of internet attacks or disruptions.  The policy implications may include not just diplomatic conflict, but also measuring the cost of the disruptions emanating from one country on another countyÃ¢Â€Â™s economy, or the cost of guarding against future attacks or disruptions.  For the cyber world, an analogy from the real world is economists are interested in understanding how goods and services flow between countries, and then understanding the policy implications of the disruptions to that flow, such as arising from trade embargo or even from piracy. I am interested in the PREDICT data sets to see if they can be used in such a study as I have described.  Thus far, little has been said about the time series and longitudinal properties of internet traffic, no doubt due to the lack of data on the subject.

By intermixing traffic from groups of similarly-behaving hosts, and assigning group identities, we aim to develop novel anonymization methodologies that provide anonymity to individual hosts within groups. Towards this end we are collecting packet-capture and netflow datasets from a variety of sources. We are looking for datasets that contain network traffic for a large amount of hosts, with long durations. We aim to extract behavior profiles from these hosts and evaluate our algorithms by splitting the dataset into train/test subsets, aiming to match the testing sub-flows with the training flows. We are not targeting USC data specifically, however, the description of the LANDERS dataset seem to match our desired properties in the data.Network traffic modeling and anonymization research.
