The mapping system will then be utilized to investigate topological characteristics of the Internet and provide an underlay for applications to optimize their communications. Compared to the existing Internet topology measurement platforms, the system will (i) build Internet topology graphs with higher accuracy as the system integrates several mechanisms to efficiently handle large-scale measurement data; (ii) work at higher level of granularity by providing backbone topology maps at link layer; (iii) periodically release annotated network topologies in addition to the raw measurement data so that the community can utilize them in their experiments and optimize network communications; (iv) help in understanding Internet topology dynamics and providing network enhancements; and (v) provide a graph indexing tool to process and analyze large-scale networks.In particular, we will be using the IP addresses discovered(actively responding to the ICMP calls) in this dataset as feed to our probing system to further expand our target range in our  measurement campaign.Web Page of our project can be found in this link: im.cse.unr.edu",1,National Science Foundation,Darleen L.

We are exploring different metrics for DoS attack detection, in particular the packet symmetry metric, as originally proposed in: Kreibich, Christian, et al. ""Using packet symmetry to curtail malicious traffic."" ACM Hotnets-IV 200 (2005). What is new in our research is the application of this approach in the context of Software Defined Networks. The basic idea of our approach (how it works) is to gather Openflow port and flow statistics from the forwarding elements (Openflow switches), and compute the packet symmetry parameter (defined as the logarithm of the ratio of sent and received packets) both on the aggregate per-port traffic, as well as per flow.Key challenges include the efficient implementation of obtaining the metric, e.g. via flow sampling, using the SDN OpenFlow protocol. We are currently implementing a DoS detection/mitigation system on top of the ONOS controller platform.The required dataset will be critical for the experimental evaluation of the performance and accuracy of our SDN-based DoS detection mechanisms. If any further details are required, please do not hesitate to contact us.",0,,,117,CAIDA DDoS 2007 Attack Dataset,UCSD - Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis,1855,TALAL,ALHARBI,Australia,University of Queensland ,Australia,Foreign,,4879,3/17/17,Approved,3/18/17,"[Quasi-Restricted] University of Southern California-Information Sciences Institute record 'DoS_DNS_amplification-20130617' requested by Pedro Pimentel from CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University",Dr. Yang Cai,Pittsburgh,"This data will be used to test new visualization tool for big data that I am currently researching at CMU, using a modified directed forced graph, whose (ultimate) purpose is using visual pattern recognition in aiding in cybersecurity threat detection and pattern recognition.

However, recent events demonstrated that cyberspace could be subjected, at the speed of light and in full anonymity, to debilitating, intimidating and disrupting attacks that might lead to severe security and economic issues. Indeed, the existence of widely available encryption and anonymizing techniques also makes the surveillance and investigation of attacks through cyberspace much harder than in traditional communication systems. In this context, cyber threat intelligence is of vital importance. A promising approach to generate cyber threat intelligence is to collect and analyze traffic destined to unused Internet addresses known as darknets. As such, there is a desideratum that consists in developing a capability for the analysis of darknets for the purpose of preventing, detecting, assessing, mitigating and attributing cyber attacks. Thus, the primary intent of this research is to address the elaboration of such a capability through the study of darknets and the design and implementation of analysis/correlation modules that will transform darknet network information in conjunction with other malware data (that the PI possesses) into significant and actionable cyber intelligence.  Few examples of such intelligence include:-Darknet traffic profiling -Inference of darknet-triggered infections/intrusions -Detection, tracking and geolocation of cybercrime servers-Detection, tracking and geolocation of depots/repositories of stolen information-Detection of corporate/governmental brand abuses-Identification and sizing of cyber attacks-Prediction of threats and malware propagationTo this end, some of this research objectives, include:-Defining darknet techniques, tools and technologies and evaluate their readiness levels-Identifying areas that require research and estimate time horizons for each of them-Profiling darknets in terms of protocols, ports, vulnerabilities, etc.-Determining key components and characteristics of darknet information required to predict attacks-Analyzing prevalent trends, threats, and risks targeting darknets-Designing and implementing a testbed for automated cyber intelligence generation. -Providing recommendations on mitigating techniques together with strategic advice on the   capability road-map of activities/initiatives that are meant to address the identified research gapsTherefore, the data will be used solely to support executing some/most of the above research goals and tasks.

The research question is the degree to which these firms compete, how they compete, and how this matters for regulatory policy including Net Neutrality.The data is needed because it characterizes the network structure, spatial disposition, and ownership structure of the Internet backbone for long-haul traffic. A market for Internet traffic is a given origin-destination pair for packets sent over the intermediating structure - origin ISP, least-cost path over the long-haul network between the origin and destination, and destination ISP. Using this data I will be able to determine which firms are on this path for every origin-destination pair between counties or census tracts within the US. The long-haul network determines how traffic flows between ISPs.The goal of the research is to determine if Net Neutrality, a particular restriction on the ability of Internet firms to price discriminate contingent on the origin and destination of traffic, is a beneficial regulatory policy for the Internet. ISP coverage is already available through the National Broadband Map.

( greater than 1TB).Dataset Choice (Why this data set?):The best penetration testers/researchers in industry, and the best security minded college students are competing against each other.  This presents a rare opportunity to analyze Ã¢Â€Âœsecurity principles in practice.Ã¢Â€ÂSince there are multiple teams, each team presents discrete sets of data for analysis of security principles.  Thus we potentially get multiple data points.Since the data is captured from a cyber competition there is a guarantee of ""malicious"" traffic, and this guarantee presents with a data set against which our goals, questions, tools, and potential solutions can be tested.The data set has clear start and finish times, and is relatively short in duration (two days), but is saturated with different types of ""malicious traffic.""The data set is as close to a standard model as a researcher may find ""in the wild.""

Students will acquire access to the Synthetically Generated Data which are generated in a synthetic environment, where benign user activity and malicious attacks are emulated by computer programs. This data includes full network packets, firewall logs, application logs, and malicious attacks. The students will use two subcategories of datasets: (1) Synthetic Cyber Exercise Data which represents traffic from a cyber-defense competition based on a typical small company network configuration of 50+ users, 7-10 servers, and common Internet services such as web server, mail server, and e-commerce site. Traffic generators continuously feed simulated user traffic into the network as users handle business requests and detect and respond to threats.(2) Synthetic Mixed Traffic from Scalable Network Monitoring Program, which include synthetic HTTP, SMTP, and DNS background data. The attacks are large scale network attacks including DNS worms, http worms, and DDoS attacks. The worms and DDoS attacks have been parameterized to exhibit various propagation characteristics. The students will understand the data format, structure, and domain knowledge. They will pre-process the collected data to make them available for further analysis, for example, turning strings of text into information that can be indexed, stored, managed and searched automatically. Component Two: Real-time security assessment Students will process and analyze the collected security data from PREDICT, such as network packets, firewall logs, application logs, etc. for security assessment intelligence processing for the network. The students will combine network traffic and logs from multiple sources and correlate events together to create real-time alerts of abnormal traffic such as distributed denial of service attack, port scans, or worm outbreaks. Catching a hacker and being able to stop them while the attack is taking place is more useful than being able to use forensics to piece together an attack that already took place. The students will apply statistical methods and data mining techniques to analyze the datasets. The real-time evaluation requires fast data retrieval, fast storage, fast processing, and fast reporting. The students will investigate the possibility of improving process speed for big data processing and analysis through optimization, parallel computing, as well as utilizing tools such as Hadoop and MapReuce for BDA, etc. Component Three: Managing and reporting results The students will develop a software system Ã¢Â€ÂœReal-time Security Assessment DashboardÃ¢Â€Â for system administrators or security analysts to monitor the real-time security assessment results and alerts using a component-based development method. This component provides a graphic user interface for the user to see interactive reports and visualizations of security assessment results. The students will investigate how to best communicate the data analysis results to the user to support intelligent decision making to protect the security of the network. Description: Students will utilize the data repository provided by the PREDICT This course will scrutinize, evaluate and utilize data repository provided by PREDICT (Protected Repository of the Defense of Infrastructure against Cyber threats). From the website: www.predict.org. Also PREDICT provides qualified evaluators and developers with continually updated network operation data that they are able to utilize in their cyber security research.

After all, many safety interventions Ã¢Â€Â“ like cancer screenings or keeping computer software up-to-date Ã¢Â€Â“ depend on the participation of the public for success.      There have been numerous studies on the relationship between actuarial risk and risk perception. It is well documented that risk perception and actuarial risk are not often aligned. For example, people perceive risks they dread or take involuntarily as more severe than others, so that skiing or plastic surgery are experienced as much less risky than they actually are.      For cyber security, the relationship between risk perception and actuarial risk is much less well studied. Most studies investigate how risk perception impacts behavior, e.g., to bank and shop online.     This study would shed light on the origins of risk perceptions rather than its consequences by combining data on actuarial risk with data from risk perception surveys in several countries. The PREDICT database would provide data on the actuarial risk, i.e., the frequency of various types of cyber-attacks. A simple regression analysis would reveal, whether people in countries suffering more attacks or in countries from which more attacks originate are more concerned about cybersecurity.     If there is a large gap between actuarial risk and risk perception Ã¢Â€Â” i.e., if people feel safe when they should not-, policy to manage cyber risk perception and to boost participation by the public in keeping computer systems safe is urgently needed. If there is no such gap, policymakers should try to benefit from the publicÃ¢Â€Â™s awareness in order to develop cost-efficient cyber risk management efforts.  ",0,NULL,NULL,261,DSHIELD Logs,University of Wisconsin,778,Frauke,Hoss,United States,Harvard Kennedy School (2),United States,Academia,,3734,9/25/14,Approved,9/25/14,Migrated DS,,"9700 South Cass Ave DIS, Bldg 221, Argonne, Illinois 60439",The data is to be used for a class project regarding the R programming language,0,NULL,NULL,433,Historical GT Malware Passive DNS Data 2011-2013,Georgia Tech,779,John,Tatar,United States,Argonne National Laboratory,United States,Governmental,,3733,9/23/14,Approved,9/24/14,Migrated DS,,"West Ave , Edinburgh, South Australia 5111","I work in the field of cyber situation awareness.

Students will acquire access to the Synthetically Generated Data which are generated in a synthetic environment, where benign user activity and malicious attacks are emulated by computer programs. This data includes full network packets, firewall logs, application logs, and malicious attacks. The students will use two subcategories of datasets: (1) Synthetic Cyber Exercise Data which represents traffic from a cyber-defense competition based on a typical small company network configuration of 50+ users, 7-10 servers, and common Internet services such as web server, mail server, and e-commerce site. Traffic generators continuously feed simulated user traffic into the network as users handle business requests and detect and respond to threats.(2) Synthetic Mixed Traffic from Scalable Network Monitoring Program, which include synthetic HTTP, SMTP, and DNS background data. The attacks are large scale network attacks including DNS worms, http worms, and DDoS attacks. The worms and DDoS attacks have been parameterized to exhibit various propagation characteristics. The students will understand the data format, structure, and domain knowledge. They will pre-process the collected data to make them available for further analysis, for example, turning strings of text into information that can be indexed, stored, managed and searched automatically. Component Two: Real-time security assessmentStudents will process and analyze the collected security data from PREDICT, such as network packets, firewall logs, application logs, etc. for security assessment intelligence processing for the network. The students will combine network traffic and logs from multiple sources and correlate events together to create real-time alerts of abnormal traffic such as distributed denial of service attack, port scans, or worm outbreaks. Catching a hacker and being able to stop them while the attack is taking place is more useful than being able to use forensics to piece together an attack that already took place. The students will apply statistical methods and data mining techniques to analyze the datasets. The real-time evaluation requires fast data retrieval, fast storage, fast processing, and fast reporting. The students will investigate the possibility of improving process speed for big data processing and analysis through optimization, parallel computing, as well as utilizing tools such as Hadoop and MapReuce for BDA, etc. Component Three: Managing and reporting resultsThe students will develop a software system Ã¢Â€ÂœReal-time Security Assessment DashboardÃ¢Â€Â for system administrators or security analysts to monitor the real-time security assessment results and alerts using a component-based development method. This component provides a graphic user interface for the user to see interactive reports and visualizations of security assessment results. The students will investigate how to best communicate the data analysis results to the user to support intelligent decision making to protect the security of the network. Description: Students will utilize the data repository provided by the PREDICT This course will scrutinize, evaluate and utilize data repository provided by PREDICT (Protected Repository of the Defense of Infrastructure against Cyber threats). From the website: www.predict.org. Also PREDICT provides qualified evaluators and developers with continually updated network operation data that they are able to utilize in their cyber security research.

Detecting such threats requires novel techniques that are not signature based, since such attacks (or, at the very least, the most dangerous ones) are often customized for a particular target, perhaps based upon substantial intelligence gathering.Accordingly, we intend to use the SKAION 2009 DARPA Dataset to test our novel anomaly detection algorithms.  This data set will provide both background ""signal"" into which we can inject our own anomalous measurements, as well as providing a data set with its own inherent anomalies.  Our main computational tools will be advanced ideas from multi-sensor fusion, compressed sensing, and dependency analysis.This work is currently being funded by the Office of the Secretary of Defense under contract #W911QX-13-C-0015.",0,NULL,NULL,303,DARPA Scalable Network Monitoring (SNM) Program Traffic,DARPA,338,Randy ,Paffenroth,United States,Numerica Corporation,United States,Commercial,,3307,6/27/13,Approved,10/11/13,Migrated DS,"Dr. Ehab Al-shaerDepartment of Software and Information Systems,College of Computing and Informatics University of North Carolina Charlotte9201 University City Blvd Charlotte, NC 28223 United StatesOffice: (704) 687-8663Fax: (704) 687-6065 ealshaer@uncc.edu","CyberDNA Research LabLocation:Woodward 305ADepartment of Software and Information Systems,UNC Charlotte9201 University City Blvd,Charlotte, NC 28223United StatesPhone:704-687-8663Fax:704-687-3516","Firewalls are the primary security devices in cyber defense. Yet, the security of firewalls depends on the quality of protection obtained by the firewall policy hardening.The lack of metrics and attack incident data make measuring the security of firewall policies a challenging task. This requires defining a set of objective metrics to measure and to compare quality of protection of firewall policies objectively.This research project intends to propose a new set of quantitative metrics that can be used to measure and to compare the security level of firewall policies in an enterprise network. The presented metrics should be proven to be (1) valid as compared with the ground truth, and (2) practically useful as each one implies actionable security hardening.

With this data, I intend to use Econometric techniques to explain two features of internet use (the field of Econometrics is a specialty in Economics, where the econometrician applies advanced statistics to economic problems).  One, I can describe and explain the time series properties of internet use and disruptions to that use.  Understanding the time series properties of the data is fundamental to understanding how the phenomenon evolves and further understanding what might affect or disrupt internet traffic.  An analogy from economics in general would be Gross Domestic Product in the United States.  Econometricians take great pains to explain the time series properties of gross domestic product in order to understand how the long run trend changes over time and how the economy fluctuates around that trend.  My project is based on the premise that understanding how internet use evolves over time is important to explaining how policy makers may or may not be able to predict when a disruption will occur, just as economists attempt to predict when a recession might occur in the economy at large. The second feature of internet use that PREDICT data may allow me to explore is the cross-country characteristics of internet use (note, data collected both over space and time is known as Ã¢Â€Âœpanel dataÃ¢Â€Â to econometricians, or Ã¢Â€Âœlongitudinal dataÃ¢Â€Â in the social sciences more broadly).  Understanding how internet use has spread across countries over time may also be important for understanding the policy implications of internet attacks or disruptions.  The policy implications may include not just diplomatic conflict, but also measuring the cost of the disruptions emanating from one country on another countyÃ¢Â€Â™s economy, or the cost of guarding against future attacks or disruptions.  For the cyber world, an analogy from the real world is economists are interested in understanding how goods and services flow between countries, and then understanding the policy implications of the disruptions to that flow, such as arising from trade embargo or even from piracy. I am interested in the PREDICT data sets to see if they can be used in such a study as I have described.  Thus far, little has been said about the time series and longitudinal properties of internet traffic, no doubt due to the lack of data on the subject.  However, with the PREDICT data, I may be able to begin to piece together a panel data set in order to address the issues alluded to above.
