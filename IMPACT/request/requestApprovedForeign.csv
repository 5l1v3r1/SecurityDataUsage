Alharbi, D. Durando, F. Pakzad and M. Portmann, ""Securing ARP in Software Defined Networks,"" 2016 IEEE 41st Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN), Dubai, 2016, pp. 523-526.T. Alharbi, M.

We are exploring different metrics for DoS attack detection, in particular the packet symmetry metric, as originally proposed in: Kreibich, Christian, et al. ""Using packet symmetry to curtail malicious traffic."" ACM Hotnets-IV 200 (2005). What is new in our research is the application of this approach in the context of Software Defined Networks. The basic idea of our approach (how it works) is to gather Openflow port and flow statistics from the forwarding elements (Openflow switches), and compute the packet symmetry parameter (defined as the logarithm of the ratio of sent and received packets) both on the aggregate per-port traffic, as well as per flow.Key challenges include the efficient implementation of obtaining the metric, e.g. via flow sampling, using the SDN OpenFlow protocol. We are currently implementing a DoS detection/mitigation system on top of the ONOS controller platform.The required dataset will be critical for the experimental evaluation of the performance and accuracy of our SDN-based DoS detection mechanisms. If any further details are required, please do not hesitate to contact us.",0,,,117,CAIDA DDoS 2007 Attack Dataset,UCSD - Center for Applied

The research question is the degree to which these firms compete, how they compete, and how this matters for regulatory policy including Net Neutrality.The data is needed because it characterizes the network structure, spatial disposition, and ownership structure of the Internet backbone for long-haul traffic. A market for Internet traffic is a given origin-destination pair for packets sent over the intermediating structure - origin ISP, least-cost path over the long-haul network between the origin and destination, and destination ISP. Using this data I will be able to determine which firms are on this path for every origin-destination pair between counties or census tracts within the US. The long-haul network determines how traffic flows between ISPs.The goal of the research is to determine if Net Neutrality, a particular restriction on the ability of Internet firms to price discriminate contingent on the origin and destination of traffic, is a beneficial regulatory policy for the Internet. ISP coverage is already available through the National Broadband Map.
