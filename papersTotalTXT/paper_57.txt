Abstract. Targeted attacks consist of sophisticated malware developed by
attackers having the resources and motivation to research targets in depth.
Although rare, such attacks are particularly diﬃcult to defend against and
can be extremely harmful. We show in this work that data relating to the pro-
ﬁles of organisations and individuals subject to targeted attacks is amenable
to study using epidemiological techniques. Considering the taxonomy of
Standard Industry Classiﬁcation (SIC) codes, the organization sizes and the
public proﬁles of individuals as potential risk factors, we design case-control
studies to calculate odds ratios reﬂecting the degree of association between
the identiﬁed risk factors and the receipt of targeted attack. We perform an
experimental validation with a large corpus of targeted attacks blocked by a
large security company’s mail scanning service during 2013-2014, revealing
that certain industry sectors and larger organizations –as well as speciﬁc
individual proﬁles – are statistically at elevated risk compared with others.
Considering targeted attacks as akin to a public health issue and adapting
techniques from epidemiology may allow the proactive identiﬁcation of those
at increased risk of attack. Our approach is a ﬁrst step towards developing a
predictive framework for the analysis of targeted threats, and may be lever-
aged for the development of cyber insurance schemes based on accurate risk
assessments.

Introduction

In recent years, we observe a dramatic increase on targeted attacks [31]. Publicised
attacks, such as Shamoon among many others, show how such attacks may cause
considerable disruption and ﬁnancial harm to Internet users. Unfortunately, the
traditional malware defense mechanisms are not adequate to detect such attacks.
Therefore, organisations need to remain vigilant for the presence of such malware
within their systems. However, targeted attacks remain rare. Many organisations
may not need to expend signiﬁcant resources in attempting to detect threats to
which they may never be exposed. Similarly, some organisations may be in imminent
danger of being attacked, yet have little security infrastructure in place to detect
and reorganisations [2].

Anecdotal evidence from publicised targeted attacks hints that certain industry
sectors and certain employee proﬁles may be at heightened risk of attack. For in-
stance, the Nitro campaign was associated with the chemical industry [8], Luckycat
aﬀected with the shipping and defence industries, among others [32, 35]. Most infa-
mously of all, Stuxnet [11, 30] targeted a speciﬁc industrial control system operating
within the energy sector.

It may be intuitive that critical industries such as defence and chemical industrial
sectors are more prone to targeted attacks than other sectors. However, this is not
suﬃcient to assess the level of risk a targeted cyber attack may pose to a given
organization. Identifying the speciﬁc industrial sectors and the speciﬁc user proﬁles
which may be at heightened risk requires more than intuition and assumption.

One method of identifying high risk sectors and employees is to consider tar-
geted attacks as akin to a public health issue. Epidemiological science has developed
various statistical techniques for discovering associations between lifestyle or ge-
netic factors, and adverse health outcomes. Once predisposing factors for diseases
have been discovered, campaigns can be instigated to educate those aﬀected of their
particular risk and how this risk can be mitigated.

Case-control studies are commonly used within health-care research to identify
risk factors within a population that are associated with developing a disease. A
risk factor is a binary variable that can be observed within members of a population
to test if the risk factor is associated with a health outcome. Such factors may be
lifestyle factors or the prior exposure to an environmental pollutant. An advantage
of case-control studies is that they can be retrospective by design, and used to
investigate groups already aﬀected by an issue. In such a study the incidence of many
potential risk factors within the members of a subject group known to by aﬄicted
by a disease (the cases) are compared with those of a second similar group that does
not have the disease (the controls). Risk factors can then be identiﬁed through their
statistical association with the disease using a well characterised methodology.

In this paper, we show that it is possible to conduct a rigorous case-control
study in which the detection of being sent a targeted attack is considered as the
outcome. Such a study can identify the potential risk factors, such as the activity
sector and size of an organisation or job characteristics of an employee, that might
be associated with being subject to a cyber attack. The identiﬁcation of these risk
factors allows organisations to assess their risk level and take proactive measures
to mitigate or at least to control this risk. Moreover, it could be also beneﬁcial for
cyber insurance systems that suﬀer from elaborated risk assessment methodologies
for assigning accurate insurance ratings to the organizations or individuals.

By applying this approach to a large corpus of targeted attacks blocked by e-
mail scanning service of a large security company, we show that larger organizations
and speciﬁc industry sectors, such as National Security and International Aﬀairs,
or the Energy and Mining sectors, are strongly associated with the risk of receiving
targeted attacks and hence can be considered of being at higher risk than other
industry sectors. Furthermore, incorporating data obtained from LinkedIn about
the employees that were targeted in these companies, we have found that not only
Directors or high-level executives are likely to be targeted, but other speciﬁc job
roles such as Personal Assistants are even more at risk of targeted attack compared
to others.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss related
works and position our contribution. Section 3 gives some background on epidemi-
ology concepts used in this work and describes the design of our case-control study.
We present and discuss our experimental results obtained with a large corpus of
targeted attacks in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Related work

The use of epidemiology concepts in computer security is not novel. However, we
note that previous work has mainly focused on malware epidemics and computer
worm epidemiology, i.e., developing analytical models for computer virus propaga-
tion and worm outbreaks within vulnerable populations in the Internet.

In the years 1991 to 1993, pioneering work by Kephart et al. extended classi-
cal epidemiological models with directed-graphs to model the behavior of computer
viruses and determine the conditions under which epidemics are more likely to oc-
cur [16, 15, 17]. Follow-up work relied mostly on the classical Susceptible → Infected
→ Recovered (SIR) epidemiology model – developed by Kermack-McKendrick for
modeling infectious disease epidemics [12, 10] – to measure the total infected popula-
tion over time during an Internet worm outbreak. Examples of such studies include
various analyses of signiﬁcant worm outbreaks such as CodeRed [39, 29, 22] and
Slammer epidemics [21]. In [38] the authors examined other types of propagation
like email worms (e.g., the Witty worm, also studied by Shannon and Moore in [28]).
Another closely related research area has looked more speciﬁcally at response
technologies for computer virus propagation and Internet worm epidemics. In early
work Wang et al. investigated the impact of immunization defenses on worm prop-
agation [36]. Subsequently Zou et al. developed a more accurate two-factor worm
model that includes the dynamic aspects of human countermeasures and the vari-
able infection rate. Then Moore et al. investigated methods for Internet quarantine
and have set up in [23] requirements for containing self-propagating code. Later, Zou
et al. proposed a dynamic quarantine defense method inspired by methods used in
epidemic disease control and evaluated the approach through simulation of three
Internet worm propagation models [40].

Follow-up work by Porras et al. studied a hybrid quarantine defense approach
by looking at potential synergies of two complementary worm quarantine defense
strategies under various worm attack proﬁles [26]. Finally, Dagon et al. extended the
classical SIR model and created a diurnal model which incorporates the impact of
time zones on botnet propagation to capture regional variations in online vulnerable
populations [9].

The analysis of the current state of the art in computer epidemiology reveals
clearly a lack of research in the ﬁeld of developing predictive analytics for more
advanced threats, such as targeted attacks. Our study is a ﬁrst step towards con-
sidering such attacks as a public health issue amenable to epidemiological studies.
However, the techniques required for modeling targeted threats are diﬀerent from
those used previously in computer worm epidemics. Targeted trojans diﬀer from
other common forms of malware in that the attacker researches and selects poten-
tial targets to which the attacks are directed. It is not necessarily the behavior of the

individual or the vulnerable status of a system that leads to exposure to malware,
but rather something speciﬁc to the individual (or the organization he belongs to)
that leads them to come to the attention of attackers.

Closer to our research is the work done by Carlinet et al. in [7], where the au-
thors have used epidemiological techniques to identify risk factors for ADSL users
to generate malicious traﬃc. The study identiﬁed that the use of web and streaming
applications and use of the Windows operating system were risk factors for appar-
ent malware infection. Recently, Bossler and Holt conducted a similar study looking
at factors associated with malware infection, ﬁnding that media piracy was posi-
tively correlated with infection, as was “associating with friends who view online
pornography”, being employed and being female [6]. In [18], the author conducted
a preliminary case-control study on academic malware recipients, using the HESA
JACS coding of academic subjects to investigate the relationship between research
interests and the receipt of targeted attacks. While the methodology used in [18]
was similar as the one used in this paper, the study was performed on a limited
scale (with only academic recipients) and at the level of individuals instead of orga-
nizations. A recent study by Levesque et. al [19] analyzes the interactions between
users, AV software and malware leveraging studies widely adopted in clinical ex-
periements. Finally, in [33] the authors provided an in-depth analysis of targeted
email attacks and the associated malware campaigns as orchestrated by various
teams of attackers.

The main contribution of this paper is to show how statistical techniques bor-
rowed from the public health community may be eﬀectively used to derive putative
risk factors associated with the proﬁles of organizations likely to be at an increased
risk of attack because, e.g., of their activity sector or organizational size. further
extended to develop a predictive framework in which the degree of risk of being
attacked could be evaluated even more precisely by combining an extended set of
relevant factors pertaining to the proﬁle of organisations or the individuals belong-
ing to them.

3 Methodology

3.1 Epidemiology concepts

In epidemiology, a commonly used method for determining if a factor is associated
with a disease consists in performing a retrospective case-control study [20] in which
a population known to be aﬄicted with a disease is compared to a similar population
that is unaﬄicted. For example, the risk of tobacco use on lung cancer is assessed
by comparing the volume of tobacco use of the population that is aﬄicted with lung
cancer(1) with the disease-free (0) population [1]. Note that, while a case control
study can be eﬀective at identifying risk factors, it cannot impart information about
the likelihood of an outcome, since we are pre-selecting an aﬄicted group rather
than searching for the aﬄiction in a random population [27].

If we now substitute “aﬄicted with a disease” with “encountered a targeted
attack”, we can use these same epidemiology techniques to identify risk factors that
are associated with targeted attacks, and leverage this knowledge to identify the
characteristics of risky organisations and individuals.

To interpret the results of a case control study, we need to calculate the odds
ratio (OR) that is a measure of the degree of association between a putative risk
factor and an outcome – the stronger the association, the higher the odds ratio [4].
Suppose that p11 is the probability of aﬄicted entities possessing the risk factor and
p01 is the probability of aﬄicted entities not possessing the risk factor. Similarly, p10
is the probability of unaﬄicted individuals within the control group also possessing
the risk factor, and p00 is the probability of unaﬄicted individuals in the control
group not possessing the risk factor. The odds ratio (OR) is then calculated as:

OR =

p11 × p00
p10 × p01

Empirical measurements that sample populations have an inherent rate of error.
To reach the test of being in excess of 95% certain that any risk factor that we have
identiﬁed is an actual risk factor and not an artefact of our test, we need to calculate
the standard error associated with our sampling using:

(cid:114) 1

SE(loge OR) =

+

1
n10

+

1
n01

+

1
n00

n11

where n11 is the number of aﬄicted entities possessing the risk factor, n10 is the
number of aﬄicted entities without the risk factor, n01 is the number of control
unaﬄicted entities with the risk factor, and n00 is the number of control unaﬄicted
entities without the risk factor. The upper and lower 95% conﬁdence values (W,X)
for the natural logarithm of the odds ratio are then calculated as:

(cid:40)

W = loge OR − (1.96 SE(loge OR))
X = loge OR + (1.96 SE(loge OR))

The 95% conﬁdence interval for the odds ratio is the exponential of W and X, eW to
eX . In order for a putative risk factor to be positively associated with an outcome
with greater than 95% probability, both eW and eX should be greater than 1.0.
For the risk factor to be negatively correlated with the outcome, both eW and eX
should be less than 1.0 [24].

3.2 Case-control study design

As our main goal is to discover risk factors for being victims of targeted attacks,
our case-control study consists in analyzing organizations and individuals that en-
countered e-mail based targeted attacks, and compare them with the ones that did
not. Note that there exists other means of exploitation to compromise the targets.
Nevertheless, the data we use for this study comprises of only attacks that spread
through e-mails and therefore, we focus on ﬁnding the risk factors for e-mail based
targeted attacks (also referred to as spear-phishing emails).

Organization level. For this study, the aﬄicted population is composed of 3,183
organisations that was identiﬁed by a large security company’s mail scanning service

as being victims of at least one e-mail based targeted attacks. Note that the process
of ﬁnding the victims involves careful manual eﬀort.

In case-control studies one crucial step is to prepare the control group selectively.
Ideally, the control group should be as large as possible, to increase the number of
subjects in the study to act to reduce the calculated standard error values and
increase the power of the study. However, this also acts to increase the resources
necessary to conduct the study. Typically the size of the control group should be in
the order of at least four times larger than the aﬄicted group [14]. Therefore, we
constructed our control group from 15,915 organisations through random selection
from 37,213 organisations that received traditional malware attacks during 2013.
It is worth noting that random sampling is usually considered as the best sam-
pling approach in order to avoid any bias in the representativeness of the control
population [5].

We performed a case-control study with two diﬀerent organization-level features
to understand whether they could be one of the risk factors for targeted attacks.
Motivating by the fact that a majority of notable targeted attacks seem to be
launched against organizations operating in speciﬁc sectors, we chose ﬁrst to in-
vestigate the industry sector of the organizations that are part of our customer
base. We identify the sector of the organizations in our control group by leveraging
both internal data sources (e.g., marketing and customer data) as well as pub-
licly available sources providing the Standard Industry Classiﬁcation (SIC) (such
as www.leadferret.com and www.companycheck.co.uk) for customers and organ-
isations lacking such detailed information. For this study, we restrict ourselves to
the primary Standard Industry Classiﬁcation (SIC) 2-digit code [25], and leave the
analysis of the more detailed SIC 4-digit classiﬁcation as future work.

The second feature we used in our case-control study is the size of the orga-
nization in terms of number of employees. Organisations were divided into 4 size
groups according to the number of employees that used the large security com-
pany’s mail scanning service. Therefore, the size we estimated for the organizations
might be smaller that organization’s actual size. Nevertheless, these numbers should
reﬂect quite accurately the organisation sizes, and more importantly, the relative
diﬀerences in size among diﬀerent organisations.

Individual level. In addition to the organizational-based risk factors, we con-
ducted a case control study to investigate individual-based risk factors that are
associated with targeted attacks. While the aﬄicted group consists of the individ-
uals that received e-mail based targeted attacks, the control group is composed of
individuals that are in the same organizations and never received targeted attacks.
The individual-based features are computed from information that can be obtained
from the corresponding LinkedIn proﬁles of the individuals.

From the 3,183 aﬄicted organizations that we studied in the previous section we
selected organizations that allow us focus only on organizations that have enough
data (at least 100 aﬄicted and 300 unaﬄicated employees) for accurate statistical
inference and that have the appropriate mailing convension (<firstname>(.|_)
<lastname>@<copanydomain> or <lastname>(.|_)<firstname>@<copanydomain>)
for their employees such that it is possible to collect her/his LinkedIn proﬁles in-
formation using the LinkedIn search API. Following these two criteria, we were

able to obtain LinkedIn proﬁles of 4150 aﬄicted individuals and 12031 unaﬄicated
individuals from 82 organizations.

The most insightful features we were able to extract from the LinkedIn proﬁles

of the users are as follows:

– Job Level: The job level indicates an employee’s position in an organization’s
hierarchy. We have considered 7 job levels: Intern, Temporary Workers, Support
Staﬀ, Individual Contributors, Managers, Directors, and Executives.

– Job Type: The job type indicates the job function performed by an employee
in an organization’s hierarchy. We have considered 9 job types: Operations,
Engineering, IT, Sales and Marketing, HR, Finance, Legal, QA, and Research.
– Location: The location ﬁeld in LinkedIn is typically free form text (e.g., San
Francisco Bay Area, Greater Mumbai Area, etc.), and may not contain the
name of a country. We look up the name of the country by searching the location
string on Google and Wikipedia.

– Number of LinkedIn Connections: We divide the number of LinkedIn connec-

tions into four groups: 0, 1-250, 250-500, and 500+.

3.3 Validation with Chi-square test

To validate the odds ratio results, we performed a chi-square test, which is com-
monly used in statistics to test the signiﬁcance of any association in a contingency
table containing frequencies for diﬀerent variables. More speciﬁcally, chi-square al-
lows to test the null hypothesis that there is no signiﬁcant association between two
(or more) variables, the alternative being that there is indeed an association of any
kind [13, 5].

In this case, we apply the chi-square test to measure the association between the
variables aﬄicted versus unaﬄicted on one hand, and has factor ’x’ versus don’t
have factor ’x’ on the other hand. For example, SIC code ’x’ versus other sector.
The same test can be performed using any other risk factor as variable, instead
of the SIC code. The test consists then in comparing the observed frequencies (O)
with the expected frequencies (E) obtained by using the marginal totals for rows
and columns. If the two variables are not associated, the expected and observed
frequencies should be close to each other and we should not observe any signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the two, any discrepancy being due to merely random variation.
The chi-square test allows us to evaluate the diﬀerence between expected and
observed frequencies: we just need to calculate the sum of the squared diﬀerences
the ﬁnal value to the distribution of the chi-square statistic with (r−1)(c−1) degrees
of freedom, where r is the number of rows and c the number of columns (i.e., in this
case we have only 1 degree of freedom). As a result, we obtain a probability value
p that allows us to accept or reject the null hypothesis with a certain conﬁdence
level. In most cases, we consider p < 0.05 as a signiﬁcant probability to safely reject
the null hypothesis, and thus conclude that there is good evidence of a relationship
between the two variables.

between the observed and expected values (i.e.,(cid:80)(O− E)2/E ), and then compare

By repeating this statistical test for each risk factor under test, we calculate the
chi-square p-value to evaluate the signiﬁcance of any association between a speciﬁc

factor and the fact of receiving targeted attacks within the selected population.
As shown in our experimental results (Section 4), it enables us to validate the
statistical signiﬁcance of Odds Ratios for any association discovered between a risk
factor and the receipt of targeted attacks. Note, however, that chi-square is not an
index of the strength of the association between the tested variables. Also, certain
categories may be excluded from the test because of a too small sample size. The
conventional criterion for a chi-square test to be valid is that at least 80% of the
expected frequencies exceed 5 and all the expected frequencies exceed 1 [13, 5].

4 Experimental Results

4.1 Organization Risk Factors

The SIC 1987 taxonomy contains 83 distinct major group codes denoted by the ﬁrst
2 digits of the SIC classiﬁcation. Of these, 78 were represented in the classiﬁcations
of organisations studied. Table 1 presents the results of the case-control study we
performed on the sector of the organizations. Because of the space limitations, we
only provide the results of the sectors that have the highest and lowest assossiation

with targeted attacks. Note that to get solid statistica results higher conﬁdence, ev-
ery test was repeated ﬁve times, and we consider the median value as ﬁnal outcome,
excluding outliers that might result as an artefact of the random sampling.

Positive statistical signiﬁcance was taken to be if the lower value of the 95%
conﬁdence interval was greater than 1.0; negative statistical signiﬁcance was taken
to be if the upper value of the 95% conﬁdence interval was less than 1.0. Using
these deﬁnitions, 37 of the major group classiﬁcations were found to be signiﬁcantly
associated with the set of organisations in the aﬄicted group, with the major group
National Security and International Aﬀairs showing the strongest association with
the targeted attacks. A further 8 major group classiﬁcations, as well as the additional
group of Nonclassiﬁable Establishments (99) were signiﬁcantly negatively associated
with the aﬄicted group. These categories, which include sectors such as Real Estate,
Legal Services, Construction or Agricultural Services, seem even protected from
receiving targeted cyber attacks. Yet, it does not mean that organizations in these
sectors will never see any targeted attack, however it is much less likely, and if this
happens, it is unlikely to be due to their business activity but rather to some other
factor.
To make it easier to further process the OR results, we have normalized them
using the customary normalization method: ORnorm = (OR − 1)/(OR + 1). By
doing so, we normalize all OR values in the range [−1, 1], with 0 as neutral value
(corresponding to OR = 1). The ORnorm results for SIC2 sectors are visualized in
Fig. 1 along with their respective conﬁdence ranges.

As mentioned earlier, the second organization-based feature we analyze is the
size of the organizations. We also wanted to evaluate whether the organisational
size may be statistically associated with the receipt of targeted attacks. The results
of this case control study is visualized in Fig. 2, which shows the normalized OR
values for the various size groups along with their respective 95% conﬁdence range.
The results indicate that as the common sense suggests the size of the organisation
is highly correlated with being at risk to targeted attacks.

While certain results might look intuitive, others can be more surprising. For ex-
ample, major SIC groups 73 (Business Services) and 15 (Construction) were ranked
in our data among the most frequently targeted sectors (in terms of absolute num-
bers), however it does not appear to be signiﬁcantly at higher risk of attack com-
pared to other categories. This might be due to the size of these categories which
may comprise a relatively larger proportion of organizations. Conversely, other cate-
gories corresponding to apparently less targeted sectors (like the Mining sector) now
appear to have very high odds ratio, and may be thus at increased risk of attack.
The same holds for the size groups, where smaller organizations (1-250) are by far
more numerous and might thus appear as more frequently targeted, however the
associated Odds Ratio shows that they are at signiﬁcantly reduced risk of attack
compared to very large companies (5000+).

4.2 Individual Risk Factors

The results for the case-control study of the four individual risk factors are pre-
sented in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Some of the results are intuitive; for example, the
directors and managers in an organization are at higher risk of being targeted than

individual contributors. While the results for number of LinkedIn connections is
fairly interesting, the results we obtain with geographical location based features
are confusing. The odds-ratio calculation of LinkedIn connections numbers feature
shows that employees who have between 1 and 500 connections are at signiﬁcantly
higher risk of being targeted when compared to people who have more than 500
connections. Based on the organizations that we have analyzed, employees based
in US, Brazil, and India are at signiﬁcantly reduced risk of being targeted, how-
ever, employees in China, Europe, and Australia are at high risk of being targeted.
This is quite surprising. While it is hard to make any reasoning without deeper
investigation, the reason for obtaining such results for the location-based feature
might be due to the nature of our data collection methodology for the individuals.
Note that the analysis we performed on individuals strongly depends on the number
of LinkenIn proﬁelds we were able to ﬁnd using the simple heuristic we explained
earlier.

4.3 Combined Results

While individual OR and ORnorm results provide interesting insights into which
risk factors might be associated with targeted attacks, in this Section we propose a

Fig. 1: Normalized Odds Ratios for the major SIC (2 digits) categories. Values above 0.0
refer to industry sectors that are at higher risk of receiving targeted attacks (the higher,
the more at risk). Sectors associated with normalized OR lower than 0.0 are protected

straightforward yet powerful technique to combine all odds ratios previously found
with respect to individual features.

A simple way to combine all normalized OR values would be to take their aver-
age. However, this method has many drawbacks, e.g., it does not take into account
the relative importance of each factor, nor their interrelationships. Hence, a smarter
and more ﬂexible way of aggregating multiple scores consists in using Multi-Criteria
Decision Analysis (MCDA), which provides mathematical tools to deﬁne advanced
aggregation models matching a set of complex requirements (The details of the
methodology could be ﬁnd in the Appendix). In this case, we wanted to assign rel-
ative importances to individual OR scores, as well as a fuzzy decision threshold on
the amount of high scores required to obtain a global score accurately reﬂecting a
signiﬁcant high risk of becoming victim of a targeted attack in the near future. For
these reasons, we decided to combine all normalized OR values using the Weighted
OWA (WOWA) operator [34], which can aggregate an input vector by taking into
account both the reliability of the information sources (as the weighted mean does),

(as the OWA operator).

WOWA makes use of two diﬀerent weighting vectors: a vector p, which quantiﬁes
the relative importances of the diﬀerent features, and a vector w, which weights the
values in relation to their relative ordering and allows us to emphasize diﬀerent
combinations of largest, smallest or mid-range values. To deﬁne these vectors, we
use both our expertise and domain knowledge gained through an in-depth analysis of
victim versus non-victim proﬁles, as well as the characteristics of various statistical
distributions of our dataset. For w we computed for every employee the number of
odds ratios higher than 1.0, and then compared the distribution of this counting
measure for victims and non-victims in our population. It turns out that starting
at a count of 4 odds ratio greater than 1.0, the two distributions cross each other,
with the number of victims largely exceeding the number of unaﬄicted customers.
Hence, we have set vector w such that it models an aggregation of “at least 4” high
scores to obtain a high combined score.

Similarly, by investigating the importance and prevalence of individual risk fac-
tors in our population, we have set the components of vector p to the following
values:

p = [0.32, 0.08, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, 0.24]

with the respective weights corresponding to the following list of features:

[SIC2, org size, job type, job level, location, nr linkedin conn]

The results of this combined analysis are displayed in Fig. 5, which represents the
distribution of combined risk scores for victims and non-victims. We only considered
here individuals having complete proﬁles and belonging to the SIC sectors for which
we could obtain statistically signiﬁcant results. Fig. 5 shows interesting and very
promising results, as we can see a clear diﬀerence in the distributions in particular
starting at combined risk scores above 0.27. By identifying additional features that
could be used as risk factors, this combined risk model would probably further
improve our capability to truly assess cyber risk, and thus to proactively identify
who is at increased risk of attack in the near future based on his/her intrinsic
characteristics. Just like for health insurance models, our combined risk model could
thus be used to design cyber insurance schemes that accurately reﬂect real-world
risks in cyber space.

4.4 Follow-up study

A case-control study is not designed to test the power of the identiﬁed risk factors
for predicting future attacks, as this would require instead a full cohort study, which
requires a signiﬁcant amount of resources and is beyond the scope of this paper.
However, to evaluate the predictive nature of our case-control study, we performed
a limited follow-up study examining subsequent attacks in the ﬁrst Quarter (Jan-
Mar) of 2014 by taking the organisational size and a limited set of SIC categories as
the only risk factors under consideration. In this follow-up study, we have observed
the proportion of targeted organisations (expressed as “1 in x” ratios) among our
sample population, the proportion of newly targeted organisations that previously

belonged to our control group (referred to as the renewal rate), and the targeted
organisations ratios as observed on a weekly basis in 2014-Q1.

In Table 3, we note that the observed incidence of targeted attack during 2014-
Q1, segmented by organisational size, is consistent with the predictive model. The
odds ratios calculated from 2013 data suggest the risk of attack increases with the
size of the organisation, and new statistics for 2014 seem to follow the very same
trend. Furthermore, the trend line showing the weekly rate of targeted organizations
is well-aligned with the predictive model calculated in 2013. Only the renewal rate
for size group 5000+ seems to be somehow an outlier (the number of newly targeted
companies in this group seems to be signiﬁcantly smaller), and may thus indicate
that attackers have initiated a change in their tactics by targeting more heavily
smaller organisations, instead of large multinational companies.

Finally, Table 2 shows the incidence of targeted attacks in 2014-Q1 for a subset
of SIC codes (2-digits). Here too, we observe the predictive model is consistent with
subsequent observations: SIC codes identiﬁed as being at higher risk of attack in
2013 exhibit much higher proportions of organizations aﬄicted by new waves of
targeted attacks in 2014. Conversely, for SIC categories that had a strong negative
statistical signiﬁcance in 2013 (Table 1), these particular sectors of activity seem

to have a protective eﬀect for those organizations, as only a few of them encounter
targeted attacks on a weekly basis (which may happen merely by accident, or due
to other circumstances perhaps).

5 Conclusion

As demonstrated by recent high-proﬁle and highly publicised attacks against gov-
ernments and large industries, cyber criminals seem to rely increasingly on more
sophisticated malware and targeted threats as an eﬀective means for industrial es-
pionage. While the high proﬁle identiﬁcation of those threats may be eﬀective in
raising awareness of the danger, it does not necessarily help in determining the level
of risk that targeted malware may really pose to an organisation. It is thus impor-
tant to develop tools for security practitioners to assess rigorously the true level of
risk to which their organization might be exposed to, e.g., because of the sector of
activity, the proﬁtability of the industry, its geographical location, or possibly any
other proﬁle characteristic susceptible of being a signiﬁcant risk factor.

In this paper, we show that these risk factors can be eﬀectively determined
for diﬀerent organizations by adapting appropriate techniques from epidemiology.
Considering the taxonomy of standard industry classiﬁcation codes and the orga-
nizational size as potential risk factors, we have designed case-control studies to
calculate odds ratios reﬂecting the degree of association with the receipt of targeted
attack. A validation with a large corpus of targeted attacks blocked by [company
name] mail scanning service during the whole year 2013 revealed that certain in-
dustry sectors – such as National Security and the Energy sectors, among others
– are statistically at elevated risk compared with others. Similarly, we found that
the risk of receiving targeted attacks increases signiﬁcantly with the organizational
size.

The epidemiology techniques used in this study may be further extended to
allow the proactive identiﬁcation of those at increased risk of attack. We believe
our study is a ﬁrst step towards developing a predictive framework for the analysis
of targeted threats, where the degree of risk of being attacked may be calculated
from a more comprehensive set of relevant factors pertaining to the proﬁle of an
organisation, or of the individuals belonging to it. A precise quantiﬁcation of these
risk factors – and more importantly, the combination hereof – will strengthen the
epidemiological model and its capability for predicting which speciﬁc individuals or
companies are the most at risk of being attacked in the near future. This, in turn,
will enable organizations to take proactive measures to mitigate or at least control
this risk by investing the appropriate level of resources.

Appendix B: Combining Odds Ratios using Multi-Criteria
Decision Analysis

We use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to design an aggregation model
for the calculation of combined risk scores, taking as input all odds ratio associated
with the individual features. A typical MCDA problem consists to evaluate a set of
alternatives w.r.t. diﬀerent criteria using an aggregation function [3]. The outcome
of this evaluation is a global score obtained with a well-deﬁned aggregation model
that incorporates a set of constraints reﬂecting the preferences and expectations of
the decision-maker.
arguments (n > 1): faggr : [0, 1]n −→ [0, 1].

An aggregation function is deﬁned as a monotonically increasing function of n

In the family of averaging aggregation functions, the Ordered Weighted Average
(OWA) operator extends these functions by combining two characteristics: (i) a
weighting vector (like in a classical weighted mean), and (ii) sorting the inputs
(usually in descending order). OWA is deﬁned as [37]:

OW Aw(x) =

wix(i) =< w, x(cid:38) >

i=1

where x(cid:38) is used to represent the vector x arranged in decreasing order: x(1) ≥
x(2) ≥ . . . ≥ x(n). This allows a decision-maker to design more complex decision
modeling schemes, in which we can ensure that only a portion of criteria is satisﬁed
without any preference on which ones precisely (e.g., “at least” k criteria satisﬁed
out of n). OWA diﬀers from a classical weighted means in that the weights are
not associated with particular inputs, but rather with their magnitude. It can thus
emphasize a subset of largest, smallest or mid-range values.

It might be useful sometimes to also take into account the reliability of each in-
formation source in the aggregation model, like in Weighted Mean (WM). Torra [34]
proposed thus a generalization of OWA, called Weighted OWA (WOWA). This ag-
gregation function quantiﬁes the reliability of the information sources with a vector
p (as the weighted mean does), and at the same time, allows to weight the values in
relation to their relative ordering with a second vector w (as the OWA operator).
It is deﬁned by [34]:

n(cid:88)

W OW Aw,p(x) =

uix(i),

n(cid:88)
 (cid:88)
 − G

i=1



pj

(cid:88)

j∈Hi

ui = G

pj

where x(i) is the ith largest component of x and the weights ui are deﬁned as

j∈Hi−1

where the set Hi = {j|xj ≥ xi} is the set of indices of the i largest elements of x, and
j≤i wj)
together with the point (0, 0). Moreover, G is required to have the two following
properties:

G is a monotone non-decreasing function that interpolates the points (i/n,(cid:80)
1. G(i/n) =(cid:80)
2. G is linear if the points (i/n,(cid:80)

j≤i wj, i = 0, . . . , n;

j≤i wj) lie on a straight line.
