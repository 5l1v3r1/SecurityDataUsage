ABSTRACT
The Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act
2011 (CAA) is a New Zealand law that aims to provide
copyright holders with legal recourse when content is ille-
gally shared over the Internet. This paper presents a study
of residential DSL user behaviour using packet traces cap-
tured at a New Zealand ISP before, shortly after and several
months after the CAA coming into eﬀect. We use libpro-
toident to classify the observed traﬃc based on the applica-
tion protocol being used to identify and examine any changes
in traﬃc patterns that may be a result of the new law. We
ﬁnd that the use of peer-to-peer applications declined sig-
niﬁcantly once the CAA was in eﬀect, suggesting a strong
correlation. We also found that there were increases in tun-
neling, secure ﬁle transfer and remote access traﬃc amongst
a small segment of the user population, which may indicate
an increased uptake in the use of foreign seedboxes to bypass
the jurisdiction of the CAA.

INTRODUCTION

The use of Internet ﬁle sharing technologies for copyright
infringement has received signiﬁcant attention from lawmak-
ers in many countries. France, South Korea and the United
Kingdom were among the ﬁrst to enact legislation allowing
for a graduated response to copyright infringement on the
Internet. These countries employ a “three-strikes” approach
where the oﬀender receives warnings for the ﬁrst and sec-
ond infringements but may have their Internet connection
terminated if infringing continues.

On the ﬁrst of September 2011, New Zealand joined these

countries with the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amend-
ment Act [15] (which we shall henceforth refer to as the
CAA). The CAA implements a graduated response system
whereby copyright owners can advise the user’s ISP when
they believe a subscriber has breached copyright. The copy-
right holder must pay a NZ $25 processing fee (approxi-
mately $20 US) to the ISP and the ISP in turn must then
issue an infringement notice to the suspected party. After
three infringements, the subscriber can be taken to the New
Zealand Copyright Tribunal by the copyright holder where
the subscriber can be ﬁned up to NZ$15,000. The law also
has a (currently inactive) provision for the termination of
an oﬀending subscriber’s Internet connection.

The CAA received widespread media coverage both inside
and outside of New Zealand and the vast majority of New
Zealand Internet users will have been aware of the new law
by the time it came into eﬀect. However, media reports
diﬀered as to whether the law was having any impact on
user behaviour, i.e. whether users had ceased ﬁle sharing.
One major New Zealand ISP reported a 10% decrease in
peer-to-peer (P2P) traﬃc, another stated that international
traﬃc had declined but was unable to determine whether
this was related to ﬁle sharing while a third claimed there
had been no discernible impact on traﬃc volumes [18]. None
of the three ISPs provided any detail as to the measurement
approach used to reach the publicised conclusions.

Therefore, we have conducted an investigation into the
application protocols used by residential DSL users in New
Zealand, both prior and subsequent to the CAA coming into
force, to analyse the eﬀect of the CAA on the behaviour of
Internet users. We have analysed packet traces captured
from a single New Zealand ISP using libprotoident [19], a
traﬃc classiﬁcation library and compared the popularity of
diﬀerent applications (e.g., P2P, web, mail) both before and
after the CAA came into eﬀect.

Unlike earlier studies that have looked at the impact of
similar laws in other countries, such as [9] and [10], our study
is based on measurements of the traﬃc sent and received by
a cross-section of Internet users. Using this approach, we
can easily and eﬀectively analyse the behaviour of a large
group of Internet users in an objective fashion.

Our results show that P2P traﬃc had more than halved
by the time the CAA became an active law, suggesting that
there may be a strong correlation between anti-ﬁle-sharing
legislation and the use of P2P applications. Traﬃc volumes
also declined notably for newsgroups and encrypted trans-
fers. By contrast, we observed that protocols which can be

551used as secure or private mechanisms for direct ﬁle trans-
fers had become much more popular than they were prior
to September 2011. These results suggest that, while the
CAA may have had the intended eﬀect of discouraging New
Zealanders from partaking in P2P ﬁle sharing, some users
have simply changed their approach to acquiring copyrighted
material to avoid detection by rights-holders.

It should be noted that, due to the diﬃculties in obtain-
ing suitable packet traces, this study has examined only a
small portion of New Zealand Internet traﬃc and therefore
we cannot irrefutably prove that the decline in P2P traﬃc
has been caused by the new law. There are other possible
reasons for the changes that we observed that cannot be
ruled out with the data that we have: for example, a global
trend in declining P2P traﬃc [12]. Therefore, the results of
this study should be seen as an observation of a strong cor-
relation that we believe is both interesting to the Internet
research community and deserving of more detailed analysis
in the future.

2. RELATED WORK

Other studies have examined the impact of laws similar to
the CAA enacted in other countries. Dejean [10] surveyed a
group of Internet users in Brittany following the enactment
of the HADOPI law in France. They found that 25% of users
had altered their downloading habits but less than 15% had
ceased using peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing entirely. Many of those
that had stopped using peer-to-peer had moved to alterna-
tive forms of ﬁle sharing, such as illegal streaming. Danaher
[9] attempted to correlate the introduction of HADOPI with
changes in online sales statistics for music. This study also
suggested that HADOPI had a measurable impact, as song
and album sales had increased signiﬁcantly compared with
other countries without similar legal ramiﬁcations for down-
loading copyrighted material.

Unlike the aforementioned research, we use Internet traﬃc
classiﬁcation techniques to conduct our study. Traﬃc clas-
siﬁcation has been a popular area of research over the past
decade, especially with regard to identifying and analysing
peer-to-peer traﬃc. The current state of the ﬁeld has been
well documented by several summary papers [7] [8] [16]. We
used the libprotoident library [19] to classify the measured
traﬃc for our study. Libprotoident is a lightweight payload
inspection tool which uses only a small amount of appli-
cation payload to identify the application protocol. This
approach is similar to that used by Aceto et al.
[3] with
the PortLoad software but, unlike libprotoident, PortLoad
is not publicly available nor has it been used to conduct any
studies similar to this one.

With regard to identifying and measuring peer-to-peer
traﬃc, Per´enyi [17] proposed a set of heuristics for iden-
tifying P2P traﬃc from NetFlow records. This technique
was used to analyse the characteristics of P2P traﬃc ob-
served at a Hungarian ISP, although they were only able to
identify individual applications in cases where the default
port was used. Another example is Hu [11] which devel-
oped behavioural proﬁles which could identify BitTorrent
and PPLive traﬃc with high accuracy. There have also
been studies using statistical and machine learning tech-
niques to identify Internet applications [6] [13] [14]. These
oﬀer promising results but do not oﬀer enough conﬁrmed re-
liability for the analysis we intended to conduct, particularly
with regard to identifying P2P traﬃc.

3. METHODOLOGY

3.1 Data Sources

Packet traces that were captured using a passive monitor
placed within the core network of a New Zealand ISP were
used for this study. Although not large by New Zealand
standards, the ISP oﬀers DSL plans that are comparable in
price, speed and data allowance with most competing ISPs
in the New Zealand broadband market. The ISP operates
on a nationwide basis and attracts customers from through-
out the country, so we believe that the data set should be
suﬃciently representative for the purposes of our study.

The monitor was able to capture all bidirectional traﬃc for
a subset of the ISP customer base. Each trace set was cap-
tured using an Endace DAG 4.3GE hardware capture card
[2] and was entirely contiguous; all packets passing through
the passive monitor between the start and end of the cap-
ture were written to disk. The trace sets are described in
more detail in Table 1.

The timing of the captures was important for this study.
The traces cover three distinct time periods: one week in
January 2011, eight days in September 2011 and eight days
in January 2012. The CAA came into eﬀect on September
1, 2011. The January 2011 capture will therefore provide a
suitable indication of user behaviour before the subscribers
became conscious of the CAA. The September 2011 capture
will demonstrate what, if any, immediate impact the new
law may have had on user behaviour. Finally, the January
2012 capture will enable us to look at the possible eﬀects
of the CAA in the medium term and compare the traﬃc
pattern with a similar time period from the previous year 1.
During the capture process, each packet was truncated to
only contain the headers up to and including the transport
header, i.e. the TCP or UDP header, plus an additional four
bytes of application payload. The extra payload (captured
with the permission of the ISP) allowed us to use libpro-
toident to classify the traﬃc, while minimising the potential
impact on the privacy of the network users.

When performing the analysis, we used IP ranges provided
by the technicians at the ISP to ﬁlter the captured traﬃc
to only include traﬃc involving residential DSL subscribers.
We chose to focus on residential DSL only as this user type
was the principal intended target of the CAA. However, we
will consider examining the eﬀect of the CAA on other user
classes, e.g. corporate Ethernet, in future work.

1Being diﬀerent months, January and September may have
had diﬀerent traﬃc patterns for non-legislative reasons.

3.2 Analysis

We developed a program to read and analyse the packet
traces using libtrace [4] and libprotoident [19]. Libtrace is
a trace processing library that supports multiple capture
formats and is required by libprotoident. Libprotoident is
a traﬃc classiﬁcation library that attempts to identify the
application protocol being used by each ﬂow observed in a
packet trace using a technique known as lightweight packet
inspection. Unlike deep packet inspection software, libpro-
toident only requires four bytes of application payload to
be present in each captured packet. The version of libpro-
toident that we used, 2.0.5, supported over 200 unique ap-
plication protocols including twelve P2P protocols and has
been shown to achieve better accuracy than existing open-
source deep packet inspection software [5].

The analysis program examined each ﬂow that started
and ended within the period covered by each trace set and
reported the number of bytes downloaded, byte uploaded
and active subscribers observed for each application proto-
col. Because the three data sets have diﬀerent durations, the
analysis and comparison of traﬃc volumes has been based
on the mean amount of traﬃc observed per day rather than
the total amount of traﬃc observed.

Each application protocol supported by libprotoident was
also assigned to a category which described the purpose of
the protocol, such as Web, P2P or Mail. The categories
that were most prominent in our data sets are described in
Table 2. In this paper, we present some results at the cate-
gory level, as this can provide a clearer view of general user
behaviour than examining popular individual applications.
One useful feature of our data set is that, unlike some
DSL providers, the ISP that we have monitored assigned
static IP addresses to DSL subscribers. We use the term
subscriber to refer to a single premise that is being provided
with broadband by the ISP. There may be multiple users
associated with a single subscription; for example, residents
of the same house who are sharing a broadband connection.
We have assumed that a local IP address in a given trace set
always corresponded to the same subscriber for the duration
of the capture. This allowed us to investigate the number of

subscribers using each application protocol or category over
the course of each trace set. However, given the likelihood
of customer churn over the course of several months, we did
not extend this assumption across trace sets.

4. RESULTS

4.1 Bytes Transferred

Figures 1 and Figure 2 show the quantity of bytes down-
loaded by residential DSL subscribers relative to the value
observed in January 2011, i.e. prior to the CAA coming
into eﬀect. Figure 1 shows the analysis on the category level
whereas Figure 2 shows the results for a selection of indi-
vidual application protocols. A category or protocol must
have contributed at least one gigabyte per day in order to
be included in either graph.

Overall, traﬃc across all categories decreased 7.5% in Jan-
uary 2012 compared with the volume observed in the previ-
ous year. Unencrypted web traﬃc was mostly static across
all three trace sets but HTTPS traﬃc tripled between Jan-
uary 2011 and January 2012.

Figure 4: Active residential DSL subscribers using
an application from each category, relative to the
subscriber count in January 2011.

There were signiﬁcant decreases in both the P2P and P2P
structure categories. Downloaded traﬃc that was recognis-
able as P2P fell by 69% between January 2011 and Septem-
ber 2011 and recovered only slightly in January 2012. P2P
structure traﬃc, i.e. P2P network maintenance traﬃc, was
less aﬀected but still decreased by 32% in September 2011.
The primary cause for the decrease in both categories ap-
peared to be a decline in BitTorrent usage. Also, Gnutella
UDP traﬃc disappeared almost entirely from the ISP net-
work, accounting for only 5% of the volume that it had in
January 2011.

The Newsgroups and Encrypted categories also experi-
enced sharp declines in traﬃc volumes in September 2011.
Binary newsgroups are commonly used for sharing ﬁles (in-
cluding copyrighted material) while many P2P ﬁle sharing
applications use SSL to encrypt traﬃc. The decrease in
encrypted traﬃc is likely because encryption does not pro-
tect against detection by copyright holders, as they detect
infringements by ﬁnding New Zealand IP addresses partic-
ipating in P2P networks that are sharing the copyrighted
content. Some major newsgroup providers have been shut

down in recent times, e.g. News-Service.com was closed in
November 2011 [1], which may have caused the decline in
NNTP traﬃc in the January 2012 dataset.

Unknown traﬃc also decreased in September 2011, which
shows that the ﬁle sharing traﬃc did not move to new unde-
tectable protocols. Rather, the decline in Unknown traﬃc
leads us to believe that the converse may have been true:
much of the Unknown traﬃc in January 2011 may have been
encrypted P2P traﬃc that we were unable to detect using
libprotoident.

By contrast, there were large increases in downloaded traf-
ﬁc matching the Files, Remote and Tunneling categories.
Figure 2 shows that this was due to the growing use of pro-
tocols such as FTP, SSH, ESP (Encapsulating Security Pro-
tocol) and Teredo. Another protocol worth mentioning that
is not present in Figure 2 is OpenVPN, which was seldom
observed in January 2011 but was much more prominent in
the later trace sets.

Our belief is that much of the growth in these categories
can be attributed to users changing their ﬁle sharing ap-
proach. Rather than participating in P2P exchanges from
home where they can be detected by copyright holders and
issued an infringement notice under the CAA, the user down-
loads ﬁles using a seedbox located in a foreign country. The
ﬁles are then copied directly back to their personal computer
using either a secure tunnel, such as a VPN, or downloaded
from a secure HTTP or FTP service running on the seedbox.
This could also explain the large growth in HTTPS traﬃc.
While Files, Remote and Tunneling traﬃc has grown sig-
niﬁcantly, the total volume of traﬃc matching those cate-
gories was still relatively small compared with P2P traﬃc,
as shown in Table 3. BitTorrent alone was still responsible
for more downloaded traﬃc than any tunneling or remote
access protocols. Furthermore, daily BitTorrent traﬃc de-
creased by 39 GB between January and September 2011
whereas growth in the daily traﬃc matching the Files, Re-
mote and Tunneling categories was less than 5 GB for the
same time period. Daily HTTPS traﬃc grew by 13 GB in
the same time period, but it is unlikely that the entire in-
crease can be attributed to seedboxes, e.g. online shopping,
Internet banking and secure login to social media sites such
as Facebook are also likely contributing factors.

Following the enactment of HADOPI in France, many
users switched to using illegal streaming to access copy-
righted content [10]. We also observed an increase in Stream-
ing traﬃc in the September 2011 data set but the growth
was not enough to suggest an uptake similar to that observed
in France. This may be partly due to New Zealand’s geo-
graphic isolation – the streaming sites hosted are not within
New Zealand and the latency to foreign sites would likely
result in a poor user experience. Rather, we suspect this in-
crease is the result of increased uptake of legal radio, music
and television streaming services which have developed an
increased presence in New Zealand recently.

The CAA was also intended to target uploaders of copy-
righted material. Figure 3 shows the traﬃc transmitted
by residential DSL users, again broken down by category.
Many of the trends observed in downloaded traﬃc were also
present in uploaded traﬃc, such as the decrease in P2P ﬁle
sharing and an increase in the Tunneling and Streaming
categories. Outgoing Mail traﬃc had also increased signif-
icantly, although it is unlikely that this is related to the
CAA.

Table 3: Bytes downloaded by DSL subscribers that matched each application protocol. “Percentage” refers
to the proportion of traﬃc in the trace set that matched the protocol.

4.2 Active Users

We also examined the number of subscribers that were ac-
tively using each application protocol to assess whether the
CAA had caused some subscribers to cease using P2P appli-
cations altogether. We deﬁned a subscriber as actively using
a protocol if a ﬂow was observed where the subscriber had ei-
ther transmitted a packet containing application payload or
received at least one megabyte of application payload from
the external host. The second condition ensured that we did
not exclude one-way passive FTP transactions as these do
not require the recipient to transmit any data.

Figure 4 shows the relative change in the number of sub-
scribers actively using an application from each of the most
prominent categories. Overall, the number of residential
DSL subscribers decreased by 16% between January 2011
and January 2012. There is no obvious reason for this de-
cline. The number of subscribers using Web, Services and
Gaming traﬃc, i.e. categories that are largely unaﬀected by
the CAA, fell by a similar amount. By contrast, the number
of subscribers using P2P protocols shrank by a much greater
amount, halving between January 2011 and January 2012.
Table 4 and Figure 5 show the percentage of subscribers
that used certain application protocols and the average vol-
ume of traﬃc downloaded per day by a subscriber when us-
ing those protocols, respectively. BitTorrent was not widely
used even before the CAA came into eﬀect. Only 8.5% of
subscribers actively used BitTorrent in January 2011. Fol-
lowing the enactment of the CAA, this value fell to 5.5%
in September 2011 and declined further to 5.2% in January
2012. Also, the amount of traﬃc downloaded per BitTorrent
user also decreased from 126 MB per day per user in January
2011 to 81 MB in January 2012. This matches the behaviour
described in [10], where some French Internet users ceased
using P2P altogether in response to the HADOPI law while
others reduced their downloading activities.

Remarkably, OpenVPN traﬃc per user went from 600 KB
per day in January 2011 to 116 MB per day in January 2012.
It is possible that this is due to subscribers using OpenVPN
to access seedboxes, although it is diﬃcult to conclusively
prove this with the data that we have. OpenVPN was only
used by 0.3% of subscribers in January 2012 which suggests

that the new usage of VPNs is restricted to a very small
group of users. Other tunneling and ﬁle transfer protocols
that were more popular, such as FTP, ESP and SSH, also
exhibited an upward trend in the mean bytes downloaded
per user, but the mean values were not as high as those
observed for OpenVPN.

Teredo was another major contributor towards the growth
in Tunneling usage. However, this is more likely due to the
increased presence of IPv6 hosts providing content than P2P
being tunneled over Teredo. The amount of Teredo traﬃc
per active Teredo user was much less than what was observed
for other Tunneling protocols and did not demonstrate the
same upward trend.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we presented the results of a study inves-
tigating changes in traﬃc patterns and Internet user be-
haviour following the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing)
Amendment Act (CAA) 2011 which came into eﬀect in New
Zealand on 1 September 2011. We used libprotoident, an
application protocol classiﬁcation library, to analyse packet

sets. “Percentage” refers to the proportion of all active subscribers that used the protocol.

traces captured at a single New Zealand ISP both before and
after the law came into eﬀect. In particular, the number of
residential DSL subscribers that were using each applica-
tion protocol as well as the volumes of traﬃc downloaded
and uploaded by those users were examined.

Our main ﬁndings are summarised as follows:

• Traﬃc downloaded using P2P applications decreased to
less than half the volume it had been prior to the CAA
coming into eﬀect. The decline persisted for several months
afterward and many subscribers appeared to have ceased
using P2P applications entirely.

• P2P uploads also decreased signiﬁcantly following the in-
troduction of the CAA. P2P traﬃc transmitted by DSL
subscribers in January 2012 was a quarter of the amount
transmitted in January 2011.

• FTP, tunneling and remote access protocols increased in
popularity following the introduction of the CAA. The
relative growth in these protocols compared with January
2011 was very large, e.g. 300% more tunneling traﬃc was
received by residential DSL subscribers in January 2012
compared to the previous year.

• The number of active subscribers and traﬃc generated by
tunneling, remote access and FTP remained much smaller
than the corresponding values for P2P, suggesting that the
observed growth in those protocols was not indicative of
a widespread change in ﬁle sharing behaviour.

• Newsgroup traﬃc almost completely disappeared after the
CAA came into eﬀect, possibly suggesting that NNTP was
being used almost exclusively for ﬁle sharing.

These results suggest that there is a strong correlation be-
tween the CAA coming into eﬀect and the behaviour of New
Zealand residential DSL users, at least in the short term.
Many subscribers appear to have abandoned P2P ﬁle shar-
ing entirely while the remaining P2P users downloaded less
content on a per-user basis than they had previously. Other
application protocol categories that were related to ﬁle shar-
ing, including newsgroups, encrypted traﬃc and unclassiﬁed
traﬃc, also experienced large declines in traﬃc volume.

Conversely, there was a distinct increase in the use of tun-
neling, secure ﬁle transfer and remote access applications
amongst a small group of subscribers. We believe that this
may be due to users responding to the CAA by changing
their approach to ﬁle sharing to limit the likelihood of being
detected by copyright holders. Rather than running P2P
applications at home, people can use seedboxes located out-
side of New Zealand to download copyrighted material and
transfer the ﬁles back to their home computer using HTTPS
or a secure tunnel. However, we note that the decrease of
P2P traﬃc observed in our study was much greater than the
amount of new traﬃc that could be associated with tunnel-
ing and ﬁle transfers.

The results presented in this paper describe the behaviour
of subscribers from one New Zealand ISP only. Other ISPs
may oﬀer subscription plans and data caps which may ap-
peal more to the people who download copyrighted ma-
terial. For example, one ISP may be more popular with
“heavy” P2P users because they sell a subscription plan with
a high oﬀ-peak data cap, whereas another ISP may only sell
plans that target subscribers with small to medium data or
bandwidth requirements. Although we believe that the sub-
scriber base that we have measured is suitably representa-
tive, we also acknowledge that this study merely represents
a single data point when it comes to evaluating the impact
of the CAA overall. A comparative analysis with other New
Zealand and international ISPs would ascertain whether the
behaviour that we have highlighted is caused by the CAA
rather than just strongly correlated.

Another avenue of future work will involve continuing this
study over a longer period of time. At the time of writing,
only three people have received a third strike under the CAA
and the copyright holders elected not to take any of the
cases to the Copyright Tribunal. Many copyright holders
(in particular, movie and television studios) are not willing
to pay the processing fee for issuing notices and the lack of
enforcement of the CAA has been widely reported. As a
result, it may prove that the decrease in P2P traﬃc that we
have observed will only be temporary.
