Abstract—Advance fee fraud scams, also known as Nigerian
scams have evolved from simple untargeted email messages
to more sophisticated scams targeted at users of classiﬁeds,
dating and other websites. Even though such scams are observed
frequently, the community’s understanding of targeted Nigerian
scam is limited since the scammers operate “underground”. In
this paper, we focus on fake payment scams targeting users on
Craigslist. To better understand this type of scam and associated
scammers, we built an automated data collection system. The
system relied on what we term magnetic honeypot advertisements.
These are advertisements that are designed to attract scammers
but repel legitimate users – similar to how a magnet attracts one
side of a magnet but repels the other. Using advertisements of
this type, we offered goods for sale on Craigslist, gathered scam
emails and interacted with scammers. We use this measurement
platform to gather three months of data and perform an in-depth
analysis. Our analysis provides us with a better understanding
of scammers’ action patterns, automation tools, scammers’ email
account usage and distribution of scammers’ geolocation. From
our analysis of this dataset, we ﬁnd that around 10 groups of
scammers were responsible for nearly half of the over 13,000 total
scam attempts we received. These groups use shipping address
and phone numbers in both Nigeria and the U.S. We also identify
potential methods of deterring these targeted scams based on
patterns in the scammer’s messages and usage of email accounts
that might enable improved ﬁlter of their initial messages by
content and email address.

INTRODUCTION

Advance fee fraud, more commonly referred to as Nigerian
scams or 419 scams1, is a prevalent form of online fraud that
not only causes ﬁnancial loss to individuals and businesses
alike [3], but also can bring emotional or psychological damage
to victim users [19]. An estimation of global losses to Nigerian
scams in 2005 is more than 3 billion dollars [14]. This scam
was originally mostly untargeted and delivered via email spam.
However, today there are more sophisticated targeted versions

1We use all three terms interchangeably in this paper.

of this scam that are directed at users of classiﬁeds, jobs and
dating sites.

In spite of its prevalence, the community’s understanding
of targeted online Nigerian scams is still lacking. Many on-
line websites, such as Craigslist, ﬁlter out scam postings to
protect its legitimate users. For example, Craigslist has many
safeguards in place to prevent scam postings, such as requiring
phone number veriﬁcation for a Craigslist account to prevent
scammers from registering large numbers of Craigslist ac-
counts and posting fraudulent advertisements, blocking suspi-
cious IP addresses and accounts, and removing advertisements
containing suspicious content. However, little is done to protect
users from receiving scam replies to their advertisements. In
addition, email service providers face a signiﬁcantly more
challenging task when attempting to ﬁlter lower volume and
target advance fee fraud spam rather than less targeted and
more common spam (e.g., pharmacy campaigns).

In this paper, we focus on Nigerian scams on Craigslist,
one of the most popular online market websites whose monthly
visitors are over 60 million in the U.S. alone2. We present an
in-depth measurement study of such scam activities. Through
this measurement study, we aim to better understand the
underground economy of Nigerian scams, and seek effective
intervention points. In particular, we seek to address questions
such as the following: “Where are scammers located?”, “How
do scam factories operate?”, “What features can we use to
distinguish a scam email from a legitimate email?”

In order to better understand Nigerian scams on Craigslist,
we posted magnetic honeypot advertisements – designed to
attract scammers but repel legitimate users. We received and
replied to scam emails resulting from our advertisements, and
analyzed the emails. For quantitative analysis of scams, we
build an automated data collection system which posts adver-
tisements, collects scam emails and interacts with scammers
by sending out a response to the received scam emails. We
also collect IP addresses of scammers to explicitly conﬁrm
geolocation of the scammers. We perform various analysis
of the massively collected dataset to better understand how
scammers work. We also cluster observed scammers into
groups based on a few key factors such as email addresses,
shipping address, phone number and email payload.

Our analysis reveals that these types of Nigerian scams
are highly prevalent as our magnetic honeypot advertisements

2http://www.craigslist.org/about/factsheet

on average received 9.6 scam replies. The most enlightening
result of our analysis is that about 50% of the scam attempts
observed can be linked back to the top 10 groups. These
groups are targeting advertisements spread over many classes
of goods and geographic regions of Craigslist. In addition, our
analysis reveals that many of the initial scam messages are
automated and arrive from a large number of email address
that are quickly abandoned. However, most of these initial
messages contain a different reply-to address to a smaller set
of longer lived email accounts. We also ﬁnd that 23% of the
shipping addresses are located in the United States, although
most of the IP addresses and shipping addresses are located in
Nigeria. This indicates there are likely either accomplices or
reshipping operations being used. Our analysis of the content
of the messages shows certain occurrences of words such as,
God, overseas military personnel, and capital letters that might
be used to help ﬁlter these messages.

From this analysis we ﬁnd several potential intervention
points. Our analysis of the message content indicates that mes-
sage ﬁltering could be improved by looking for combinations
of these pattern such as a reply-to address that does not match
the sender’s address, usage of these uncommon phrases, and
identiﬁcation and blacklisting of these more stable and long-
lived secondary accounts. Also, shipping addresses might be
the starting point for law enforcement investigations. Along
these same lines the fact that only ten groups of scammers
accounted for nearly half of the scams we received indicates
that it might be possible to target and disrupt these groups,
greatly reducing the prevalence of this scam.

II. RELATED WORKS

There have been a number of previous studies that have
looked at the structure by Smith [14], Buchaman and Grant [1]
and estimated losses from advance fee fraud by Dyrud [2].
Whitty and Buchaman [19] and Rege [13] have investigated the
dynamics of online dating scams. More broadly, Stajano and
Wilson [15] created a taxonomy of the different types of psy-
chology motivations used by scammers. Garg and Nilizadeh [5]
investigated whether economic, structural and cultural char-
acteristics of a community affects the scams on Craigslist.
Their work focuses on potential scammers’ advertisements
posted on Craigslist. Tive [18] introduced in his study various
techniques of advance fee fraud. Herley [7] has argued that
Nigerian scammers deliberately craft
their messages to be
unbelievable as a method of reducing the number of replies
from people that are unlikely to fall victim to these scams.
In contrast, our study aimed to be more focused on collecting
empirical data to enable a data-driven analysis that does not
rely in self reported statistics. Isacenkova et al. [8] identiﬁed
a thousand scam groups from an existing scam email dataset
with the help of a multi-dimensional clustering technique. This
study also argued that scammers’ email addresses and phone
numbers are crucial factors of the clustering. Goa et al. [4]
investigates the use of ontology-based knowledge engineering
for Nigerian scam email text mining. Unlike previous studies,
in our investigation we have focused on 1) understanding in
great depth the prevalence and techniques, and 2) identifying
the structure of larger scale groups of scammers that are
engaged in attempting to defraud people posting goods for
sale on Craigslist.

victim to send the goods to the scammer-indicated mailing address.

Another large body of recent work has set about con-
ducting empirical measurements to understand the dynamics
and economic underpinnings of different types of cybercrime.
Much of this work has been focused on spam email [9], [16],
illicit online pharmacies [11], and mapping out scam hosting
infrastructure [10], [17]. Our work builds on this, but focuses
deeply on the Nigerian scam problem in particular. We have
conducted, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst large scale empirical
measurement study of 419 scams. It provides us with insights
into how these scams are organized and how they might be
better deterred in the future.

III. DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY

We have built an automated data collection system that
collects scam data on Craigslist as illustrated in Figure 1. Our
data collection methodology is explained below.

A. Creating magnetic honeypot posts

Our data collection focused on selling a variety of goods

on Craigslist.

Our idea is to create magnetic honeypot advertisements that
would selectively attract scammers but not legitimate users.
To do this, we post unattractive advertisements, e.g., selling
a used iPad at a price higher than new. More speciﬁcally, we
choose goods among a list of popular items on Amazon to
make sure that the goods we are selling can be easily bought
from Amazon or anywhere else. The selling price is set to
be a little bit higher than the price of new product found on
Amazon. Any sensible real user would conceivably not reply to
such posts. However, scammers would — they might be using
bots to crawl Craigslist or automate the response process, or
might not carefully check the contents of each post due to lack
of labor.

We made sure that our data collection methodology con-
forms to good ethical standards, as further discussed in Sec-
tion III-D.

2

B. Automated communication with scammers

We have built an automated conversation engine that per-
forms linguistic analysis of incoming emails from scammers,
and automatically engages in multiple rounds of communica-
tion with scammers. The engine periodically checks inboxes
of email accounts used for Craigslist accounts and reads in all
unread emails. Then it classiﬁes the emails to identify valid
scam emails. Our automated engine replies to a subset of the
scam emails we receive — speciﬁcally, emails with a subject
line that replies directly to the subject of our post. Henceforth,
our automated engine exchanges multiple rounds of emails
with the scammer, leading to the fraud attempt, e.g., fake
PayPal notiﬁcations or fake checks. The most common type
of fraud we observe is a fake PayPal notiﬁcation stating that
funds have arrived at the victim’s PayPal account, followed by
requests for the victim to send the product to the scammer’s
mailing address.

A typical example of email conversation is posted in Figure

2, and more examples are posted in Appendix A.

C. IP address collection

The IP address of an email sender provides insightful in-
formation, such as scammers’ geolocation. However, collecting
IP addresses from email headers is not always feasible when
the emails are relayed by the site (e.g., Craigslist), or if the
webmail provider does not include source IP address in email
headers (e.g., Gmail). To collect IP addresses of scammers, our
automated conversation engine embeds an external image link
into emails generated in response to a received scam email.
Since the embedded link leads to a web server under our
control, we can collect IP addresses of anyone who accesses
image ﬁles we’ve embedded. The embedded link is unique to
the corresponding advertisement so that we can later analyze
the collected IP addresses based on factors such as city, product
category and price.

D. Ethics

Since our experiment ultimately deals with human subjects,
we put several controls in place to manage any harm to
the participants. In addition, we went through the process of
getting our experiment approved by our institution’s human
subjects review process. During the experiment, we collected
scam emails by posting honey pot advertisements which may
attract responses from legitimate users as well as scammers.
Even though our honey pot advertisements are designed to
be “unattractive” such that
legitimate users would not be
interested in replying, it is still possible that our experiment
might receive responses from legitimate users that send an
actual payment
that we have posted on
Craigslist. In order to prevent this unintentional “victimiza-
tion”, we consistently check if there were any actual payments
made by legitimate Craigslist users. If a payment was made by
a legitimate user, the victim would be provided with pertinent
information about our experiment, and the item would be
shipped to them or the refund procedure would be initiated
immediately. In addition, any messages from this user would
be purged from our collected data. Note that fortunately, we
found no payment made by any legitimate users during the
entire experiment.

Fig. 2. Example 419 scam thread. The ﬁrst scam response usually has one
or couple of simple sentences showing scammer’s interest in goods posted by
the victim. The second scam response contains a fraud attempt through fake
PayPal or bogus check. The scammer’s offer is usually attractive since their
offer price is higher than then victim’s list price. Finally, the third and later
scam responses urge the victim to send the goods to the designated mailing
address.

Another issue concerns how we use the collected data that
might contain private information about scammers. Throughout
the experiment, we gathered messages that contain information
such as shipping addresses and phone numbers which could
potentially be used to identify scammers. We limit the use of
raw data to email addresses, IPs, and text from messages that
will not clearly identify the actual identity of the scammer.
All other information is only included in aggregate to avoid
revealing the identity of any scammers.

Finally, we adhered to Craigslist’s terms of use regarding
posting advertisements 3. Speciﬁcally, each of our accounts
only posted in a single location and were restricted to a posting
rate of once every 48 hours.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In Sections IV and V to follow, we ﬁrst present a summary
of the dataset we collected and our ﬁndings of this measure-
ment study.

A. Dataset

Table I presents a summary of the dataset we collected
using the methodology described in Section III. More details
of each part of the table are explained below.

1) Overview and terminology: Our 419 scam data collec-
tion spans a duration of roughly three months, from 4/15/2013
to 7/19/2013. We selected 20 locations including 10 large and
10 small cities/areas from a list provided by Craigslist. The
large cities include San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Boston,
LA, San Diego, Portland, Washington DC, Chicago and Denver
and small cities/areas include Twin Tiers, Cumberland Val-
ley, Meadville, Susanville, Siskiyou, Hanford-Corcoran, Santa
Maria, Winchester, Southwest and Eastern Colorado.

We selected four product categories including cell phone,
computer, jewelry and auto parts, which are used by many
Craigslist users and therefore, many advertisements are posted
daily posted as usual. As mentioned in Section III-D, we posted
our ads at very low rates, so that they account for only an
unnoticeable fraction of the total trafﬁc volume in each city on
Craigslist. Speciﬁcally, we posted at most one advertisement
per category per city every 48 hours, which makes at most
80 advertisements per 48 hours in total. The price of products
used in the experiments ranged from $80 to $7, 000.

Table II shows the terminology that we use to refer to

honeypot ads and received emails throughout the paper.

Terminology

2) Magnetic Honeypot Advertisements: During the exper-
iment, we posted 1, 376 magnetic honeypot advertisements
over 20 large and small cities in the U.S. Among the whole
advertisements posted, 747 advertisements were ﬂagged by
Craigslist, leaving 629 effective advertisements. 42 emails ac-
counts (Craigslist accounts) were used during the experiment.
We designed our system to post magnetic honeypot adver-
tisements evenly distributed over posting time and product
category to minimize possible biases in the collected dataset.
Figure 3 illustrates distribution of effective advertisements over
time of day. In this ﬁgure, the slight unevenness in distribution
(over different times of the day and product category) partly
stems from Craigslist’s ﬂagging policy.

The average number of effective ads posted per each hour
is 26.2 and the standard deviation is 4. The average number
of effective ads posted per product category is 157.3 with the
standard deviation of 20.2. It is believed that the degree of
variation observed in both distribution would not cause any
signiﬁcant bias in the collected dataset.

3) Collected emails and threads: The total number of
emails received during the experiment was 19, 204 and the
number of emails sent is 9, 902. Several emails in the same
conversation are together referred to as a thread.

Among the total of 19, 204 emails received in our data
collection 15, 270 were ﬁrst responses. Among these ﬁrst
responses, our ﬁlter determined that 13, 215 represented scam-
related activities, whereas the remaining include spams and
fake PayPal payment emails and emails delivered from email
service providers. As a result, our system attracted 9.6 scam
trials (ﬁrst scam responses) per ad.

From the 13, 215 scam-related ﬁrst responses, our au-
tomated data collection engine sent 8, 048 ﬁrst replies. As
mentioned in Section III, presently we only send replies to
emails that directly reply to our posts. There are 9, 008 out
of 13, 215 ﬁrst responses reply directly to our posts — by
including the subject line that we used for our ads.

For 1, 626 of the threads, we received a second response
from the scammer. Finally, we received 751 fake PayPal pay-
ment notiﬁcations emails and 885 bogus check fraud attempts.
Note that we received multiple fake PayPal payment emails
for some threads, and it was not always possible to tie a
PayPal notiﬁcation back to an email conversation thread, since
for most fake PayPal notiﬁcations the source email address is
different from those used in the email conversation.

B. Analysis of scammers’ IP addresses

As described in III, we collected IP addresses of scammers
by embedding an external link to a product image. We gathered
IP addresses from web logs of the server that hosts product
image ﬁles.

1) IP geolocation: In the experiment, we observed 965 IP
addresses over 22 countries. The total number of accesses
to the image hosting server from those IP addresses were
7, 759, and each IP address was observed 8 times on average.
Figure 4 illustrates the IP geolocation of scammers who have
accessed the embedded image links more than once. The

Summary of experimental result

IP Geolocation of scammers. For 965 IP addresses observed, 50.3% is are from Nigeria and 37.6% are from the U.S.

source hostip.info4 was referenced to retrieve a geolocation
information of each IP address.

Scammers’ IP addresses were observed from all over the
world but most of them were located in Nigeria and the U.S. In
particular, 50.3% of collected IP addresses were from Nigeria
and 37.6% were from the U.S. Note that this ﬁgure is plotted
based on the number of unique IP addresses observed. It is
also possible that some scammers could be using proxies, so
the IP geo-location does not reﬂect their true location.

In Figure 5, the distribution of IP addresses over number
of C and B class subnets is illustrated. We observed 413 class
C subnets in total, and 40 of them take about half of whole
IP addresses. Also, 10 out of 243 class B subnets account for
about half of whole IP address. The result shows that small
portion of subnets take major number of IP addresses observed,
and it might imply the possibility of small number of scam
factories dominating whole scam business.

2) IP blacklist: We cross-checked the collected IP ad-
dresses with a publicly available blacklist, Project Honey
Pot [12] containing IP addresses of user-reported spam and
and scam generators. The result is outlined in Table III. In
particular, Project Honey Pot contains blacklisted IP addresses
which were conﬁrmed to be malicious; and graylisted ad-

dresses, which were detected but have not been conﬁrmed to
be malicious. From the IP addresses we collected, 40.4% are
blacklisted by Project Honey Pot. 14% of IP addresses are in
graylisted but not blacklisted. 1.7% of collected IP addresses
are conﬁrmed to belong to web crawlers such as MSN search
engines.

About 43% out of the 965 IP addresses we found have not
been blacklisted or graylisted by Project Honey Pot. Therefore,
one contribution of our measurement study is to provide data
to supplement existing IP blacklists.

Table IV shows the top 20 IP addresses by the number of
access to the external link embedded in our replies. 19 of top
20 IP addresses are conﬁrmed to be located in Nigeria. More
interestingly, 10 of them belong to the same class C subnet,
41.206.15.0/24, which strongly implies that they are part of
the same scam factory. One of top 20 IP addresses is located
in the U.S. and conﬁrmed to be Microsoft’s web crawler. We
suppose that the accesses from Microsoft were due to our use
of Hotmail accounts. Other than one IP address of web crawler,
4 out of 19 IP addresses are not blacklisted yet.

C. Analysis of scammers’ email accounts

1) Source, reply-to address discrepancy, and email account
reuse: Throughout the experiment, we collected 4, 433 email
accounts used for ﬁrst responses of 13, 215 scam threads,
indicating average reuse counts of 3 per an email account.
The most frequently reused email account appeared in 101
threads. Figure 6 shows the distribution of email reuse counts.
2, 410 email accounts, that is, 54.4% of total email accounts
observed, were used in only one thread and about 10% were
used in more than 6 threads. The majority of these single use
only email addresses were initial inquiries about the product
availability that never matriculated into further negotiations.
However, many others were supporting emails used in the
furtherance of the scam such as fake PayPal notiﬁcations,
transportation agents, threats to contact the FBI (for when the
product was not shipped) and similar emails. Some examples
are posted in Appendix A.

We also observe that for 81.9% of the ﬁrst responses
received, the source email address is not the same as the reply-
to address, and for 19.4% of the second responses received, the
source email address is not the same as the reply-to address.
This source and reply-to address discrepancy is shown in
Table V. The percentage of discrepancy was much higher,
97.6% for ﬁrst responses, within the top 10 groups. The
operating procedures of top tier organizations must account
for the increased quantity of emails sent and received, both
for management and security, which is why they are more apt
to split source and reply-to accounts.

Figure 7 shows that the set of source email addresses
observed is much larger than the number of reply-to addresses
observed. It is possible that the large pool of source addresses
are disposable, and potentially automated, accounts that can
be readily discarded and replaced as they are blacklisted. On
the other hand the second, smaller tier of addresses are for
more manageable monitoring and generally attempted to be
kept “clean” for continued use over time. This intuition is
supported by Table VI. We found a case that a single reply-
to address was mapped to 108 source addresses. For total of
1, 980 reply-to addresses, 141 were mapped to more than 10
source addresses.

Gmail is preferred by majority number of scammers, despite the highest PVA(Phone Veriﬁed Account) price, possibly since Gmail is the only webmail service

provider which supports free IMAP/SMTP and hides email senders’ IP addresses.

2) Email service provider: Table VII shows the proportion
of each email provider the scammer uses,
in comparison
with the provider’s estimated world-wide market share as
reported by Geekwire [6]. We ﬁnd that the top email provider
used by scammers is Gmail, which accounted for 65% of
the scammer email accounts observed, followed by Microsoft
(Hotmail and Live), which accounted for 10% of the scammer
email accounts observed. Interestingly, in terms of world-wide
market share, Yahoo is placed ﬁrst, with a market share of
42.8% [6]. However, Yahoo only accounted for 3.5% of the
email addresses we observed.

It is interesting to correlate this with underground market
prices of bulk email accounts. Many PVA (Phone Veriﬁed
Account) sellers of black market sell Gmail accounts for a
price higher than other emails such as Yahoo or Microsoft.
For example, one PVA seller5 sells 1000 Gmail accounts for
$90, 1000 Yahoo accounts for $15, 1000 Hotmail accounts for
$5 and 1000 AOL accounts for $50.

Despite the most expensive market price, scammers seem
to prefer Gmail over other email services. The reason for this
might be the fact that Gmail is the only email service provider
who supports free IMAP/SMTP and also hides IP address
of email senders among top 4 email providers. IMAP/SMTP
is imperatively necessary for scammers, since they deal with
massive amount of emails. Also, since scammers are working
underground,
to hide their IP addresses
not to expose themselves and possibly to avoid ﬁltering by
email service provider of the recipient. Scammers’ aversion to
Yahoo can also be clearly explained, since Yahoo charges $20
for SMTP/IMAP services. Although Microsoft supports free
POP3/SMTP, those features were enabled recently in 2009.

Shipping Addresses

In this context, Gmail might be the reasonable solution for
scammers.

3) Sample bad email addresses: We also observed inter-
esting “clusters” of bad email addresses. For example, the
following email addresses we observed are close variants of
each other:

biglanre1@gmail.com
biglanre10@gmail.com
biglanre11@gmail.com
biglanre12@gmail.com
biglanre13@gmail.com
biglanre14@gmail.com
biglanre4@gmail.com
biglanre5@googlemail.com

This clearly shows that a scammer or a group of scammers
create several email accounts to send out massive amount of
scam emails.

D. Shipping Addresses and Phone Numbers

1) Shipping Addresses: 153 distinct shipping addresses
were identiﬁed throughout the study by threads that progressed
far enough so that shipment of the product was expected. As
with IP addresses discussed in IV-B, the majority, 70%, of
the shipping addresses were located in Nigeria with 23% and
7% located in the United States and other foreign countries
respectively (Table VIII). Some shipping addresses had mul-
tiple names, assumed to be aliases, associated with them. In
one circumstance, seven names were associated with a single
Nigerian address. For the classiﬁcation of the threads into
groups, emails with the same shipping address were assessed
as belonging to the same group. Additionally, some addresses
were in close proximity to each other. For example, three dif-
ferent apartment numbers for the same street address in Nigeria
were used as shipping addresses. In these circumstances, the
threads were not assessed as belonging to the same group since
being neighbors did not deﬁnitively indicate the occupants
were part of the same organization.

2) Phone Numbers: 206 distinct phone numbers were
identiﬁed during the study (Table IX). Most were given either
as part of the initial inquiry or during the follow-on negotiation

emails, with only a few numbers withheld until
the end
of the purchase and then provided along with the shipping
address. Diverging from the pattern seen with IP addresses and
shipping addresses, the majority of the phone numbers, 91%,
are registered within the United States and relatively balanced,
but slightly in favor of, voice over internet protocol (VOIP)
over cellular numbers. Of the 15 phone numbers identiﬁed as
registered overseas, 12 were Nigerian, and all of these were
associated with completed scam attempts and aligned with
distinct Nigerian shipping addresses. Four phone numbers were
either missing digits or area codes and therefore could not be
categorized.

E. Scam Patterns

We report interesting patterns observed, including the dis-
tribution of scams received during various times of the day;
response delay of the scammer; and what factors affect the
scammer’s response rate.

1) When do scammers work: The distribution of received
time of ﬁrst and second scam responses are illustrated in Figure
8. Figure 8a shows the distribution of posting time of effective
advertisements and the received time of ﬁrst scam responses.
During the experiment, our automated data collection system
posted advertisements evenly across the whole time of day.
After removing the ads ﬂagged by Craigslist, however, the
number of effective ads varies slightly across different times
of the day. Average number of effective advertisements at each
hour is 26.2, the minimum number is 20 and the maximum
number is 38.

Figure 8a and Figure 8b show that both the ﬁrst and second
scammer responses peak during 11AM to 6PM, and from 8PM
to 10PM UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), This corresponds
to the time period between 12PM to 7PM WAT (West Africa
Time), which largely overlaps with working time in Nigeria.
Moreover, the time period with the lowest scam responses is
between 12AM and 6AM UTC, and it corresponds to 1AM to
7AM WAT. In addition, our ﬁrst replies sent also peak during
Nigeria’s work hours, because our automated engine polls the
emails every three hours and responds to the new emails. These
observations support the result discussed in Section IV-B that
the majority of the collected IP addresses are from Nigeria.

2) How fast do scammers respond: Figure 9 shows the
distribution of scammers’ response time. Only 6.5% of ﬁrst
scam emails were received within 6 hour and about 36%
were received within 24 hours. The response time can be an
indication of the level of automation of scam factories. We
will discuss scam process automation later in IV-F.

On the other hand, we can observe much faster response
time for second scam responses. 26.5% of second scam

responses were received within an hour from the ﬁrst reply
of ours, and about 90% were received within 24 hours. This is
likely due to the fact that our automated engine sends replies
to scammers no later than 3 hours from receipt of their scam
email. Figure 8b shows our ﬁrst replies peak during the work
hours in Nigeria. This explains why scammers respond more
quickly to our ﬁrst replies.

Fig. 10. Number of ﬁrst scam responses per effective ad. Each of Auto
parts ad attracted 17.6 ﬁrst scam responses in average while each of computers
ad attracted 5 ﬁrst scam responses. For this plot, we used a subset of the scam
threads which we were able to link to an ad.

3) Do product category and price affect scammers’ re-
sponse rate: As shown in Figure 10, each of our ads attracted
2.2 to 19.8 scam trials, depending on the category of the
advertisement. The number of scam trials per Auto parts
advertisement is 17.6 while the plot shows 9.7 for Cell phone,
6.7 for Jewelry and 5 for Computers. An interesting pattern
observed here is that scammers seem to prefer a speciﬁc
product category, Auto parts, over others. We ran one-way
ANOVA test and conﬁrmed that scam trials per auto parts ad
were higher than other types of ads with P-value of 0.01. In
addition, we conﬁrmed that scam trials per cell phone ad were
signiﬁcantly larger than jewelry and computers. We are not
able to state an explicit reason for the higher number of scam
trials per ad for Auto part category in this paper. Reasoning
for this observation would be left as a future work.

The number of advertisements posted by all Craigslist
users is not a valid factor since we observed almost similar
number of advertisements over 4 product categories used in
our experiment. Also, price does not seem to be a valid factor
since we are not able to ﬁnd out any consistent pattern in 10
in terms of product price. We were not able to ﬁnd out any
correlation between number of scam trials and product price.

F. Level of Automation

One interesting question is whether the scam process is

automated, and to what extent is it automated.

By combining various clues, such as inter-arrival time for
the same email address and received email distribution across
various times of the day, we can draw the conclusion that the
scam process is automated to some extent, but not completely
so. More details are provided in Table X and below.

1) Signs of automation: We observed clear signs of au-
tomation, including duplicate or templated responses observed
in all stages of the scam process, outcome of broken scripts in
subject lines, extremely short inter-arrival times for the same
email address.

We now provide more explanation on the inter-arrival times
for the same email address. Table XI shows some of the largest
email bursts received. An email burst is a sequence of emails
sent from the same email address within a very short time

interval (no more than 15 seconds between emails). Table XI
suggests that the largest bursts observed consists roughly 8 to
15 emails, with a mean interarrival time of 2.5 to 5 seconds.
These bursts were not directed solely at Craigslist ads within a
single city. One burst sent 15 email messages to multiple ads
across 3 different cities. More interestingly, two of the largest
bursts observed consist solely of second replies.

We also observed many emails (including ﬁrst response,
second and later responses, as well as payment notiﬁcations)
have exactly the same contents, or clearly use the same
template to generate the content (Figure 13 in Appendix A).
We also observed outcomes of broken scripts in ﬁrst responses
received. These demonstrate that the scammer are using some
(semi-)automated tools to automate their response process, and
more interestingly, their tools sometimes broke and generated
email subject lines that are not human readable (Figure 15 in
Appendix A).

2) Signs of manual labor: On the other hand, we also
observe signs of manual labor. First, according to Figure 8,
scam responses peak during working hours in Nigeria, which
accounted for 50% of the IP addresses we observed in Figure 4.
Second, we received Second and later scam responses con-
taining curses — presumably the scammer was frustrated with
us not shipping them the goods. Interestingly, we observed
same curse emails occurring multiple times (Figure 17 in
Appendix A). It is likely in this case that the angry scammer
is copying and pasting the curse response. Also, in the latter
stage of our data collection, some curse emails were received
as a second response, before even reaching the payment stage
— this could be a sign that the scammer actually started to
detect our automated data collection.

The overall analysis of scam automation is outlined in

Table X.

V. CLASSIFICATION

In order

to discover how prevalently these scam-
mers/organizations infected Craigslist and determine the scope
of their operations, we classiﬁed the email messages into
groups based on similarities within their attributes.

A. Conservative Classiﬁcation Strategy

We ﬁrst used a very conservative clustering strategy to
classify scam activities observed into scammer groups. Specif-
ically, if two scam threads shared exactly the same email
addresses, shipping address, or phone numbers,
they are
grouped as the same scammer group. Email addresses whose
preﬁx were 90% identical were individually reviewed along

with other attributes such as email textual content and IP
addresses so series such as the biglanreXX@gmail.com
addresses noted earlier were also grouped together when
multiple attributes showed similarities. In this way, we are
highly conﬁdent that two scam threads belong to the same
scammer group when we place them into the same cluster.

B. Top 10 Groups

Based on our very conservative classiﬁcation strategy, we
found that the top 10 groups accounted for 48% of all received
scam threads (see Figure 11a).

Further analysis of the top 10 groups showed that they op-
erate over (almost) all cities where we posted ads (Table XII),
and most of them throughout the entire duration of our data
collection (Table XIII). Additionally, all groups responded to
ads from all categories of products we advertised, cell phone,
computer, jewelry and auto parts.

We give more detailed information about the top 10 groups
below. Table XII lists details including the number of threads
associated with the group, source and reply-to email addresses,
associated shipping addresses and phone numbers for the top
10 groups by number of threads. Almost all of the top 10
groups had an extremely high ratio (ranging from 86.9% to
100.0%) of threads whose source email address is different
from the reply-to address, Group 10 had a 86.9% ratio which
was anomalous until it was discovered that a single email
address was used as both the source and reply-to address in
11.1% of the threads.

Interestingly, only one of the top groups had shipping
addresses associated with the group. Our assessment is that
9 groups are more sophisticated in their separation of initial
inquiries and transition to scam attempts, successfully seg-
regating the two in order to keep their clean accounts and
personal information off blacklists. One group on the other
hand appears unconcerned with this separation, working on
a volume basis using the same email addresses and phone
numbers for ﬁnalizing scam attempts that are used throughout
the negotiating process.

Table XIII and Figure 12 show group activities over time.
We make the following interesting observations. First, as
mentioned earlier, all top 10 groups were active throughout the
entire duration of the data collection. Second, Figure 12 shows
that peak activities of a subset of the top 10 groups aligned
with each other (e.g., the 5 plots on the left-hand side had
aligned peaks and lulls). As mentioned later in Section V-C,
some of the top 10 groups merged when we used slightly
more aggressive grouping criteria — therefore, it is likely that
in reality, a subset of the top 10 groups are actually the same

gives more evidence to support this hypothesis.

Finally, activities for most groups tapered off towards the
end of the data collection, partly due to a combination of
several reasons: the lack of new postings near the end of
the research period, the expiration of postings created earlier,
Craigslist’s ﬂagging of some of our postings, and additionally,
some scammers may have started detecting our automated data
collection.

C. More Aggressive Grouping Strategy and Findings

Our ﬁrst grouping strategy in section V-A was extremely
conservative. There are many other attributes that we could
have used in the grouping, but chose not to. For example, for
similar email addresses, while we manually inspected a subset
of them and marked them as being the same group, such as
the aforementioned biglanreXX@gmail.com; for others such
as madelineXX@gmail.com and alexandraXX@gmail.com
we conservatively chose not to mark them as the same, since
Madeline and Alexandra are common English names.

We observe, however, that if one applied a slightly more
aggressive grouping criterion, some of the top 10 groups would
have merged. For example, Figure 11b shows the grouping
results if we additionally merged IP addresses from the same
class C subnet to the same group. In this case, the 4th and
10th largest groups from Figure 11a are merged, and is now
the biggest group in Figure 11b. The remaining ordering of
the top 10 are preserved.

Figure 11c shows the grouping results if we additionally
merged email addresses 90% similar to the same group. The
similarity between two email addresses A and B (containing
only the substring before ) is deﬁned as:

sim(A, B) := 1  

edit dist(A, B)

min(len(A), len(B))

Intuitively, a 90% similarity between two email addresses
means every 1 out of 10 characters may be different. In
Figure 11c, the 6th and 8th largest groups from Figure 11a are
merged, and is elevated to the largest group. The remaining
ordering of the top 10 are preserved.

D. Classiﬁcation Summary

Summarizing the above, our classiﬁcation effort clearly
indicates that a small number of scam groups account for half
or more of the total scam activities we observed. These scam
groups work across all cities, and were continuously observed
throughout the data collection.

VI. LESSONS LEARNED

When we embarked on building our initial measurement
collection infrastructure we did not know what type of replies

we would be receiving to our magnetic honeypot advertise-
ments. Based on our experiments and analysis we have discov-
ered many potentially useful improvements to our infrastruc-
ture. In this section be will describe some of these challenges
of our plans of deploying some potential improvements.

The ﬁrst observation is that the scammers often do not
include the correct subject in their replies to our advertise-
ments. This causes our automated reply process to discard
these messages, which is simple to overcome by replying to
all messages received. The more challenging problem is that
our analysis could not link these postings back to the speciﬁc
advertisement the scammers were responding to because we
were posting multiple advertisements with a single account.
In addition, messages such as forged PayPal notiﬁcations
were sent by the scammers that could not be linked due to
different subjects from the original advertisement. In some
cases we could manually link these messages to the correct
advertisements. However, this could be solved by using an
individual email address for each posting. We are implement-
ing this by registering domain names, since creating large
numbers of webmail accounts would violate their terms of
service and would be labor intensive. However, from our initial
results these custom domain names receive half the responses
from scammers as compared to email addresses from well
known webmail providers. This indicates that we might need
to explore other methods of linking accounts using webmail
accounts, since appear to be more attractive to scammers.

The second observation is that IP collection methods, such
as embedding links to images in messages are effective at
gathering information. We have improved this infrastructure
to generate unique links that can be linked back to the
advertisement. In the future we plan to improve this tracking
by adding additional code to our server that will set cookies.
These cookies will enable us to link multiple scam attempts to
an individual if they use the same computer and do not clear
their cookies.

VII. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

We have presented an in depth data-driven analysis of
Nigerian scammers. This section will serve to provide a higher
level view of our analysis to put it into context and discuss
how our analysis might be used to deter these types of scams.
In addition, we will describe future work that are planning
to undertake that will improve our understand of these scams
even further.
Larger Organizations. Our clustering results reveal that a
large portion of the scam attempts are originating from a
small set of groups that we can link together via their reuse
of email addresses, shipping address, phone numbers, and
similarity of the content in their messages. Our conservative
estimate is that ten groups are responsible for about 50% of
the scam attempts we received6 This indicates that while this
scam is highly prevalent that are only a relative small number
of groups engaged in this activity. If these groups could be
disrupted it would have a large impact on reducing the number
of people targeted. As future work we plan to improve our

6Note as we become less conservative with our clustering criteria some of
the small group begin to merge into the larger groups and some of the larger
groups begin to merge together.

measurement infrastructure to collect more information such as
browser cookies that will enable us to more accurately cluster
these groups. We will also work on improving our ability to
estimate how many individuals are involved in this scam and
the division of labor among the individuals within each group.
Locations of Scammers. We also ﬁnd that all of major groups
are based in Nigeria based on IP and shipping addresses.
However, some of these groups use shipping addresses in
both Nigeria and the U.S. This indicates that they might have
some limited ability to receive packages and reship them to
Nigeria. As future work, we plan to identify shipping addresses
associated with the major groups and ship them items with
GPS tracking units embedded into the device. This will give
us more insight into how and where the stolen goods are resold.
Methods and Tools. Our analysis offers many clues about the
level of automation and sophistication of the tools used by
these scammers. We have found strong evidence of automated
tools that are run manually or require manual attending. In
addition, we ﬁnd that these tools are used to automate both
initial responses and in some cases follow-up responses. Also,
some of these tools are able to crawl multiple geographic
regions on Craigslist and parse the posting’s subjects and
contents to include in the reply. However, some the tools
are fairly limited and include static text in the body of the
reply or cannot parse subjects of listings. This relative lack of
sophistication in these tools indicate it would be possible to
incorporate the static messages into spam ﬁlters and at least
force the scammers to develop more advanced tools. As future
work we plan to design experiments focused on gaining more
insight into the tools being used and their limitations. This
might include crafting messages that ask questions targeted
at better understand which messages from the scammers are
automated.
Email Account Usage. Our analysis of email accounts used
be the scammers, shows that they tend to use a large number
of email address for the initial message that are quickly
abandoned. However, they normally set the reply-to address in
the initial message to a different email address that is reused
often and longer lived. These longer lived email accounts
offer a potentially better point of intervention, since it
is
conceivable these accounts can be blacklisted or banned before
the scammer completes multiple email exchanges with the
victim. In addition, as future work we will provide these
email addresses to webmail providers and corporations such
as PayPal to see if they have been used for other scams. This
analysis might in turn help identify additional email accounts
used by these groups.
Filtering Messages. In the course of our analysis we also
identiﬁed many recurring themes in the content of the mes-
sages. These included the scammers claiming to be overseas
military personnel to explain why they were located in Nigeria.
Including religious content in their messages to gain the trust
of their victim. Finally,
they often used abusive language
to coerce their victims into actually shipping the items. In
addition, it would be feasible to exploit common linguistic
features of scam email contents [4]. The combination of these
patterns and the different reply-to address might be effectively
used to improve the ﬁltering of these messages. As future work
will test this hypothesis by building improved ﬁlters that are
more effective at detecting Nigerian scam messages.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have presented a large scale empirical
analysis of targeted Nigerian scams observed on Craigslist.
From this we have learned valuable information on a variety
of scam patterns such as scammers’ working time and their
response time to our ads and emails and discussed a degree
of automation of scam process. Our analysis of IP addresses
and shipping addresses indicates that the majority of scammers
are located in Nigeria, but there is a smaller presence in the
USA. We also found that around 10 groups account for almost
half of scam attempts. Finally, we presented some higher level
discussions based on our analysis and identify some potential
points along this scam to intervene that might prove to be
effective at deterring these scams.
