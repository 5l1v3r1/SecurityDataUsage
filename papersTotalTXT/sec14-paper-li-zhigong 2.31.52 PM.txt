Abstract
Users speaking different languages may prefer different
patterns in creating their passwords, and thus knowledge
on English passwords cannot help to guess passwords
from other languages well. Research has already shown
Chinese passwords are one of the most difﬁcult ones to
guess. We believe that the conclusion is biased because,
to the best of our knowledge, little empirical study has
examined regional differences of passwords on a large
scale, especially on Chinese passwords. In this paper, we
study the differences between passwords from Chinese
and English speaking users, leveraging over 100 million
leaked and publicly available passwords from Chinese
and international websites in recent years. We found that
Chinese prefer digits when composing their passwords
while English users prefer letters, especially lowercase
letters. However, their strength against password guess-
ing is similar. Second, we observe that both users pre-
fer to use the patterns that they are familiar with, e.g.,
Chinese Pinyins for Chinese and English words for En-
glish users. Third, we observe that both Chinese and En-
glish users prefer their conventional format when they
use dates to construct passwords. Based on these obser-
vations, we improve a PCFG (Probabilistic Context-Free
Grammar) based password guessing method by inserting
Pinyins (about 2.3% more entries) into the attack dictio-
nary and insert our observed composition rules into the
guessing rule set. As a result, our experiments show that
the efﬁciency of password guessing increases by 34%.

Introduction

Passwords are the most widely used credentials for au-
thenticating Web users around the world, including the
users that do not speak English. Text-based passwords
are likely to remain the dominant mechanism for authen-
ticating users for the foreseeable future [7][19]. Mean-
while, researchers are still in the process of understand-

ing the security strength of passwords and exploiting
methods to improve password guessing. Although in-
sightful, most existing work focuses on passwords of
English users. Little work has studied the impact of re-
gional convention and languages on password selection
utilizing a large dataset of passwords. One exception is
Bonneau [6], who studied password strength based on
languages by performing an empirical study on Yahoo!
users and concluded that Chinese passwords are among
the hardest ones to guess. We believe his ﬁnding is bi-
ased because of his dataset (i.e., Yahoo users are familiar
with English). In this paper, we analyze passwords of
non-English speakers, speciﬁcally, Chinese users, which
represent 618 million Internet users as of the end of
2013 [12], and compare them with passwords of English
users.

To understand the differences between Chinese and
English passwords, this paper leverages over 100 mil-
lion leaked and publicly available passwords from sev-
eral popular Chinese websites (CSDN [13], Tianya [33],
Duduniu [17], 7k7k [5], and 178.com [4]) and English
websites (RockYou [30] and yahoo [37]). These Chinese
websites only provide Chinese webpages, and we con-
sider their users as Chinese users. In addition, English
websites mainly intend to serve users who are familiar
with English, and we consider the users of RockYou and
Yahoo as English users. Note that, these websites (ex-
cept Duduniu, which is an e-commerce website) pro-
vide similar services, i.e., non-monetary ones such as
web portal, online communities, social networking, on-
line forums, etc. Thus, we consider them comparable
and having similar inﬂuence on their users when choos-
ing passwords. This makes their password data corpus
promising for studying the impact of languages on pass-
word composition.

The unfortunate leakages of the large volume of pass-
words provides us an opportunity to understand pass-
word differences between the two groups of users in
depth. Such analysis is important, because it enables

better password guessing evaluation and can guide web
masters to protect the accounts.

We designed analysis tools and leveraged the guess-
ing resistance indicators (such as α-work-factors [28]
and β -success-rates [10]) to ﬁnd the differences among
accounts of multiple websites, and found the prefer-
ence of the two groups of users. Then, we improved
the efﬁciency of the Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar
(PCFG) based password guessing method [35] by adding
regionally preferred patterns (i.e. Pinyins) into the dic-
tionary and modifying the generated guessing rules. We
summarize our ﬁndings and main contributions as fol-
lows:

• Different Characters Sets: Chinese users prefer
digits in their passwords, while English users pre-
fer letters, especially lowercase letters. However,
the password strength against guessing is similar for
both groups and thus both groups share similar se-
curity concerns in protecting passwords.

• Patterns of Languages and Dates: Both Chinese
and English users prefer to use language-related
patterns as passwords. That is, Chinese users pre-
fer Chinese Pinyins and English users prefer En-
glish words. As for dates, both groups prefer their
conventional formats. That is, Chinese prefer dates
with the year at the beginning and English users pre-
fer dates with the year at the end.

• Improvement of

the Efﬁciency of Password
Guessing: Based on our observations, we add
20,000 Pinyins into the dictionary and add the
guessing rules, resulting in an improvement of efﬁ-
ciency by 34% in guessing Chinese passwords using
a PCFG based guessing method. This conﬁrms that
the Pinyins and date’s rules are important in guess-
ing Chinese passwords.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
summarizes our observations on the differences between
passwords from Chinese and English users. Section 3

presents the results of guessing using modiﬁed Bon-
neau’s methods [6] and PCFG based methods [35]. In
Section 4, we discuss the related work and conclude in
Section 5.

2 Regional Differences on Passwords

2.1 Dataset Setup
To discover the differences between the passwords of
Chinese and English users, we analyzed a corpus of over
100 million passwords from multiple websites that are in
Chinese and English, respectively. All the leaked pass-
words are publicly available for downloading. During
our research, we followed the ethical practice and never
utilized the leaked passwords for reasons other than un-
derstanding the overall statistical observation of pass-
words.

At the end of 2010, an incident that is known as CSDN
Password Leakage Incident happened, and passwords
from ﬁve websites, including CSDN, Tianya, Duduniu,
7k7k and 178.com, were leaked in several consecutive
days. The total number of leaked accounts is over 80
million, and all the leaked passwords are in plaintext. We
summarize the website information in Table 1.

CSDN [13] is one of the most popular Chinese IT pro-
fessional communities, similar to MSDN. Tianya [33] is
the largest online forums and blogs in China. 7k7k [5]
and 178.com [4] are two websites providing game infor-

mation and online ﬂash games. Duduniu [17] is a com-
mercial site that mainly sells management software plat-
forms for Internet bars. It is worth noting that all these
websites are extremely popular in China, among which
CSDN and Tianya have been ranked top 1,000 in Alexa
Top Global Sites recently. Thus, their users cover a large
percentage of Internet users in China.

Besides their popularity, the leaked password data cor-
pus is promising for understanding the language impact
on passwords because few password policies are en-
forced in the above ﬁve Chinese websites before the leak-
age according to our investigation. For example, CSDN
allows a password with as few as ﬁve digits, and such
a rule remains unchanged even after the password leak-
age event. Furthermore, Tianya allows passwords as
short as six characters since it was founded. Thus, the
leaked password data corpus represents the password set
that was composed with little inﬂuence from password
policies.

Password leakage events also happened to English
websites as well.
In 2009, attackers broke into the
database of RockYou and released the 32 million pass-
words (in plaintext) to the public. In 2012, Yahoo’s ac-
counts were leaked. A hacking group ‘DD3Ds Com-
pany’ utilized a union-based SQL injection to obtain lo-
gin details of about 450 thousand user accounts.

The raw ﬁles contain duplication and blank passwords
that can affect the analysis. For instance, we detected that
attackers copied a portion of 7k7k passwords to Tianya,
because the password duplication rate between Tianya
and 7k7k is much more than the rate between any other
two websites (i.e., about 90% between Tianya and 7k7k
and about 30% between any other two websites). We
thus removed these duplicate passwords in Tianya us-
ing the method described in Appendix A. After remov-
ing the accounts with blank passwords and ﬁltering out
duplicated accounts, we obtained 105,836,958 accounts,

as detailed in Table 1. Finally, we imported them into
MySQL for further analysis.

2.2 Password Comparison
2.2.1 The Most Popular Passwords
We list the ﬁve most popular passwords of Chinese and
English users in Table 2, from which we have the follow-
ing observations:

• In total, the ﬁve most popular passwords constitute
4.14% of all Chinese passwords and 1.69% of all
English passwords, which shows that Chinese pass-
words are more congregated.

• Interestingly, although in English datasets, there are
a larger number of letter-only passwords (see details
in Section 2.2.3), the top 3 most popular passwords
are digit-only. In addition, both groups share similar
popular passwords, e.g., 123456 and 123456789.

2.2.2 Character Distribution
To understand the frequency of each character, which in-
cludes letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and symbols (all
printable characters except digits and letters), we ana-
lyzed the percentage of each character for Chinese and
English passwords and depict them in Figure 1, where
the characters are arranged in descending order accord-
ing to the percentages in Chinese passwords.

• Digits. In Chinese passwords, the top used charac-
ters are digits. Although English users do not use
digits as frequently as Chinese users do, digits are
among the most frequently used characters.

• Letters. In general, Chinese passwords use letters
less frequently than English passwords do. In addi-
tion, some letters exhibit similar usage percentages

in both Chinese websites and English ones. D represents a digit, and L represents a lowercase letter.

for both groups of passwords, e.g., the letter a is
the mostly used letter in both groups. Some letters
show distinct usages, e.g., the letter q is frequently
used in Chinese passwords but is much less used in
English passwords; the letter r is much more popu-
lar in English passwords than in Chinese ones. This
is because of the word patterns in either languages.
For instance, the letters q and a are popular build-
ing blocks of Pinyins, but the letter r is not. We will
discuss Chinese Pinyins and English words in detail
in Section 2.2.5.

• Symbols. Symbols are used less in both Chinese
and English passwords, in general. Interestingly, for
both groups of passwords, several symbols share the
similar usage percentages: the symbol dot (.) is the
most frequently used, and symbols like left brace
({) and right brace (}) are less likely to be used.
However, regional differences on symbol usages do
exist: the question mark (?) is more frequently used
in Chinese passwords than in English passwords.

2.2.3 Compositions and Structures of Passwords
To understand the structures of passwords in both groups,
we analyzed passwords in two aspects. (1) we divided

passwords according to their compositions and calcu-
lated the percentages in seven category (shown in Ta-
ble 3). The categories are pure digits, pure letters, dig-
its and letters, letters and symbols, etc.
(2) We cal-
culated the percentages of different types of password
structures utilizing representations in the Probabilistic
Context-Free Grammar [35]. For example, the structure
of Johns0n! is modeled as ULLLLDLS (U = uppercase,
L= lowercase, D = digit, and S = symbol). The structure
comparison of both password groups is shown in Table 4
where # of Structures/10K refers to the number of dif-
ferent structures in every 10,000 passwords. The most
popular structure is the one that appears the most in the
data-set. From Table 3 and Table 4, we can obtain the
following observations:

• A majority (around 50% on average) of Chinese
users prefer digit-only passwords. This could be
due to their language. Chinese characters cannot be
entered directly as a password, and digits appear to
be the best candidate when users are creating new
passwords. Although Chinese users can use Pinyins
as discussed in Section 2.2.5, digits seem to be more
convenient. As shown in Table 4, DDDDDD is the
dominant structure in most Chinese websites. For

yet they are neither in the Same Row or Zig Zag,
e.g., zxcfgh.

Algorithm to Identify Keyboard Patterns. In order
to automatically classify passwords into the aforemen-
tioned three categories, we assign a coordinate to each
character on the keyboard. We deﬁne that the x-axis in-
creases from left to right and the y-axis increases from
top to bottom. For example, the coordinates of 1 (and
!) are (1,0), and the coordinates of q, a, and z are (1,1),
(1,2), and (1,3), respectively. Provided the coordinates of
the characters, we can determine if a password is in a spe-
ciﬁc keyboard pattern using the algorithm illustrated in
Algorithm 1, where isAd jacent(pos1, pos2) determines
whether two letters located in the coordinates pos1 and
pos2 are adjacent in the same row or column.

Result. The statistics analyzed by Algorithm 1 is
shown in Table 5, from which we observe that more
than 8% of Chinese passwords are composed according
to keyboard patterns but fewer English passwords are.
After removing all digit-only passwords, the keyboard
pattern passwords reduce to about 1%. This is because
most passwords of the same row pattern are digit only.
Nevertheless, Chinese users tend to use keyboard pattern
passwords more often than English users do, e.g., there
are 0.2% more Zig Zag passwords for Chinese than En-
glish users. This could be because keyboard patterns are
easy to create and remember for Chinese users who are
unfamiliar with English.

2.2.5 Chinese Pinyins and English Words

Chinese Pinyin was developed in 1950s and is de-
signed to represent the pronunciation of Chinese char-
acters. Although there are lots of dialects in China, the
Pinyins for characters are the same. Trained with Pinyin
since primary school, Chinese computer users are famil-
iar with it. Pinyin is the most popular method to input
Chinese characters to a computer because it requires al-
most no extra training for Chinese. Typically, a Chinese
character is entered by multiple keystrokes. Although
other input methods, such as Wubi, exist, these methods
are not as popular due to their steep learning curves.

Since websites do not support passwords composed of
Chinese characters directly, unsurprisingly, just like the
words in English passwords, Pinyins are widely used in
passwords of Chinese users.
Ignoring the tones, typi-
cally, a word in Pinyins uses a set of 21 sounds repre-
senting the beginning of the word called initials, and a set
of 37 sounds representing the end of the word called ﬁ-
nals. These two combine to form about 420 different ba-
sic Pinyin elements [3]. However, users may use various
compositions of multiple Pinyins in their passwords. For
example, the password nihao, is composed of Pinyins ni
and hao.

Figure 2: A typical layout of a keyboard (103P) used in
China, which is the same as an English keyboard layout.

CSDN, the structure DDDDDDDD is the top selec-
tion, and DDDDDD is ranked at 14. A six-digit
number may be an ATM PIN, a birthday, or the last
six digits of citizen ID cards. We will discuss details
in Section 2.2.6.

• For both password groups, a good portion of pass-
words contain both letters and digits, and no obvi-
ous differences seem to exist between these web-
sites. The owners of the passwords in this category
could be users who are concerned with password
security but are unwilling to bother with symbols.

2.2.4 Keyboard Patterns
Sometimes, users prefer to create their passwords ac-
cording to keyboard patterns [32]. Thus, we analyzed
the percentages of three primary keyboard patterns. Note
that Chinese users utilize standard English keyboards
(shown in Figure 2), i.e., they use the same ones as En-
glish users.

• Same Row: The same row passwords are formed
by a consecutive sequence of characters in the same
row on keyboard, e.g., asdfhj.

• Zig Zag: The zig-zag passwords are formed by a
sequence of characters, where each key is adjacent
to the next one but not in the same row, e.g., qawsxd.
• Snake: The snake passwords consist of a sequence
of characters whose keys are adjacent on keyboards

Table 7: The most popular Chinese Pinyins and English

all the Pinyins we extracted from letter-only and mixed
passwords in ﬁve Chinese websites. Similarly, the per-
centage base for top English words is all the words we
extracted from letter-only and mixed passwords in both
English websites.

Algorithm to Identify Pinyins or English Words.
We can determine whether a password is composed of
Chinese Pinyins or English words by string matching.
For example, a password helloworld is composed of En-
glish words hello and world. For English words, we
chose the Oxford English Dictionary [1] and extracted
more than 20,000 commonly used English words.

To improve the matching efﬁciency, we use Trie (or
preﬁx tree) to identify if the passwords are composed
of Chinese Pinyins or English words. We ﬁrst construct
Trie by inserting Chinese Pinyins or English words one
by one. With the Tries, we can identify if a password
is composed of Chinese Pinyins or English words. The
algorithm to insert entries into the Trie is shown in Algo-
rithm 2. In our experiments, we constructed two Tries:
one is constructed out of Chinese Pinyins, and the other
is built based on the more than 20,000 commonly used
English words. The procedure to identify if a password is
composed of Chinese Pinyins or English words is shown
in Algorithm 3. The structure node has two properties.

The ﬁrst is named as child, which is an array of node
and represents the child nodes. The second is a boolean,
isValue, which represents if the string from the root to
the current node is a valid value. The algorithm will try
to match the password with the known strings from Trie
recursively.

Note that because it is hard to determine the semantic
meaning, a password may be semantically meaningless
even if it is a composition of Chinese Pinyins or En-
glish words. Furthermore, some passwords can be in-
terpreted as compositions of Pinyins and English words
at the same time. We removed the passwords with both
Pinyins and English words in our analysis.

Result. We performed statistical analysis of the usage
of Chinese Pinyins and English words in two aspects.
Firstly, we calculated the percentages of passwords that
are composed of Chinese Pinyins or English words out
of all the letter-only passwords. Secondly, we calculated
the percentages of Pinyins or English words out of all
the mixed passwords (i.e., the ones contain at least two
types of characters with one of them being letters). The
results are shown in Table 6. Table 7 lists the top ﬁve
most popular Chinese Pinyins and English words. From
Table 6 and 7, we draw the following conclusions:

• Out of the letter-only passwords, Pinyins are the
dominant patterns for Chinese users in composing
their passwords, and English words dominate the
English passwords. Even when we consider all cat-
egories of passwords, these patterns are still the ba-
sic building blocks for a large portion of passwords,
i.e., more than 10% English passwords contain En-
glish words, and about 5% of Chinese passwords
consist of Pinyins.

• Interestingly, it seems that love is always the main
theme of human beings. As shown in Table 7, love

and iloveyou are ranked at the second and the third
in English passwords. Meanwhile, woaini is the top
ranked Pinyin, which means I love you in Chinese.

• The Pinyins of names are widely used in Chinese
passwords. The Pinyins li, wang and zhang, listed
as the top used Pinyins for passwords in Table 7, are
among the most popular surnames in China. Note
that it is difﬁcult to identify ﬁrst names in Chinese,
because they could be almost any combinations of
Pinyins.

• The website names appear to be an important part of
Chinese passwords. For example, tianya, which is
the website name, is ranked at the fourth in Chinese
Pinyins.

• We found that some passwords from RockYou and
Yahoo are composed of Pinyins, and we suspect that
the owners are Chinese. Most of these Pinyins do
not map to meaningful expression, and thus we sus-
pect they are names. For example, yaowei, which is
composed of Pinyins yao and wei, is most likely to
be a name because either yao or wei can be a sur-
name.

The inﬂuence of Chinese Pinyins in password guess-

ing is discussed in Section 3.2.

2.2.6 Dates

Given that digits are commonly used in passwords, we
try to understand the meaning of these digits. Since dates
are typically represented as a string of digits, in this sub-
section we analyze the usage of dates in passwords.

Date Format. We focused our attention on six-digit
and eight-digit dates. We ﬁrst extracted all consecu-
tive sequences of exactly six or eight digits from these
passwords, and then calculated the dates which are in
the range from 1900 to 2099. We classiﬁed six-digit
dates into three formats: YYMMDD, MMDDYY, and
DDMMYY. Similarly, we classify eight-digit dates into
YYYYMMDD, MMDDYYYY and DDMMYYYY. The re-
sults are shown in Table 8 and 9. Note that there might
be ambiguity when interpreting dates. For example,
11121987 may be interpreted as either November 12,
1987 or December 11, 1987. In this case, we assigned
the passwords to one of the formats according to the
probability distribution of all the passwords that can be
uniquely determined. For instance, if 20% of passwords
that contain date can be uniquely identiﬁed as MMDDYY
and 80% of them as DDMMYY. Then, we assigned 20%
of the ambiguous passwords to MMDDYY and 80% to
DDMMYY.

Furthermore, there may be false positive where a gen-
eral six-digit number is considered as a date. For exam-
ple, 123123 could be considered as December 31, 1923,

but most likely it is just two consecutive 123. Thus, we
selected 30 six-digit numbers that might cause such type
of false positive 1. Granted that we could have introduced
false negatives or cannot manage to remove all the false
positives for sure, these 30 numbers represent the pat-
terns that have special meanings or are easy to remem-
ber, and most likely they do not map to any dates. For
instance, ‘520520’ has a similar sound as ‘ i love you i
love you’ in Chinese. Thus, we believe that eliminating
them will increase the accuracy of our statistics.

Table 8 and Table 9 show the results. For example, the
29.24% in the ﬁrst row in Table 8 means that among the
1,621,954 eight-digit numbers, 29.24% of them are in the
format of YYYYMMDD. We can conclude that Chinese
users prefer to use the format YYYYMMDD and YYM-
MDD. This conforms with Chinese conventions where
people prefer to begin dates with years. On the contrary,
a majority of English users prefer to end the date with
years.

Password Composition. What are the compositions
of passwords that contain dates? Are they composed of
pure digits or mixed with letters? We calculated the per-
centages of digit-only, letter and digit, symbol and digit,
letter and digit and symbol passwords out of all pass-
words that contain dates (both six-digit and eight-digit
dates). As shown in Table 10, for all Chinese and En-
glish websites except Duduniu, most dates observed in
our analysis are digit-only passwords, i.e., when dates
are used as passwords, they are used alone. What ranks
the second is the passwords containing letters and digits.
Note for Duduniu, the passwords that contain dates are
more likely to contain both digits and letters than digits
only. This could be because Duduniu is an e-commerce
website and its users tend to choose a password with
stronger strength, i.e., they tend to select passwords with

Date Position. To understand the position of dates
in passwords, we analyzed those passwords that contain
dates (digit-only passwords are not included).

We categorize the position of the dates as beginning,
middle, and end, and summarize the results in Table 11.
For both Chinese and English users, they prefer to have
dates appear at the end of passwords and rarely place
them in the middle.

2.3 Resistance to Guessing
Given the huge differences between Chinese and English
passwords, a fundamental question is whether those dif-
ferences lead to different levels of password strength. In
this section, we examine password strength against pass-
word cracking.

2.3.1 Metrics to Measure Password Sets
We evaluated how resistant those passwords are against
guessing by using the measurement metrics adopted by
Bonneau [6][8], which are designed to evaluate the pass-
word strength in different regions.

As shown in Table 12, we brieﬂy introduce these met-
rics: H∞ is deﬁned as min-entropy, a worst-case secu-

rity metric for human-chosen passwords, i.e., when a
user chooses the mostly likely password. G is deﬁned
as guesswork, representing the expected number of se-
quential guesses to ﬁnd a password of an account if an
attacker proceeds in an optimal order, i.e., trying pass-
words in a descending order of the password probabil-
ity. µα is called marginal guesswork or α-work-factor,
which measures the expected number of guesses needed
to succeed with probability α. Marginal success rate or
β -success rate, λβ , represents the probability that an at-
tacker can correctly guess the password of an account
given β guesses. Gα, the α-guesswork, reﬂects the ex-
pected number of guesses per account to achieve a suc-
cess rate α.

To be more intuitive to programmers and cryptogra-
phers, we can convert these metrics into units of bits by
taking the logarithmic value. We use a tilde over each
letter to denote the values that are converted into bits: ˜G,
˜µα and ˜Gα.

In this section, we follow the same assumption as pro-
posed by Bonneau [6][8], i.e., attackers know the exact
distributions of the target password set and calculate the
password strength, i.e., the attackers utilize the distribu-
tion of passwords to crack passwords in the same web-
site. We call it intra-site guessing. In the next section,
we relax the assumption, and we examine the guessing
efﬁciency if the attackers are only aware of password dis-
tribution of other websites.

2.3.2 Resistance to Intra-Site Guessing

We summarize the calculated metrics for each website in
Table 13 and Figure 3, and we draw the following obser-
vations:

• In Table 13, we observe that

the β -success-
rates (λ5, λ10) of RockYou and Yahoo are much
lower than those of Chinese websites, i.e., given
β (e.g.,5,10) guesses, the probability of guessing
Chinese passwords correctly is higher. This phe-
nomenon shows that Chinese websites have a lot of
repeated passwords, but the G0.25 and G0.5 are sim-
ilar (less than 3) between Chinese and English web-
sites (except 178.com). Thus, it may be easier to
guess a small proportion of Chinese passwords, but
for a majority of Chinese passwords, guessing them
becomes as hard as guessing English ones.

• In Figure 3, the value of α-work-factors of CSDN,
Tianya and 7k7k are small if the expected success
rate α is small, but it grows quickly with the in-
crease of α. This phenomenon indicates that al-
though part of Chinese users use the weak pass-
words that are easy to guess, a considerable number
of users still carefully select passwords to protect
their accounts. In addition, the users of Duduniu
tend to choose better passwords. One possible ex-
planation is that Duduniu involves monetary trans-
action and users tend to choose secure passwords.

Overall, the table shows that a small portion of Chinese passwords are repreaded and weak, but guessing a majority of
Chinese passwords is as hard as guessing English ones.

3 Cross-Region Guessing

In this section, we would like to answer the following
questions.

• Given that an attacker only has the password distri-
bution of English websites, how well can she guess
the passwords of Chinese websites?

• Given the knowledge of the differences between
Chinese and English passwords, can an attacker im-
prove the efﬁciency of guessing the passwords of
Chinese websites?

The following two subsections answer these two ques-

tions.

3.1 Cross-Site Password Guessing
In this section, we examine how well an attacker can
guess passwords from a website when she only possesses

a password set of another website, and we call such sce-
narios as cross-site password guessing. This represents
the situation when an attacker want to crack passwords
of a website whose passwords have never been leaked.
We modify the metrics that are modeled for the intra-
website password guessing (listed in Table 12) to eval-
uate cross-site password guessing. We use two metrics,
α-work-factors and β -success-rates, to evaluate the re-
sistance to cross-site guessing. We denote these two met-
rics by adding a check symbol:

Table 14: β -success-rates of cross-site guessing. The data in columns 2 and 3 maps to the scenarios that we used
each Chinese datesets to guess Rockyou passwords, and the data in columns 4 and 5 maps to the ones that we used
Rockyou passwords to guess the ones of each Chinese website. These data shows that the cross-site guessing between
Chinese and English users is hard.

In the above metrics, p(other)i refers to the probabil-
ity of the other websites’ i-th password in X . For ex-
ample, we utilize the CSDN’s optimal password order to
estimate the strength of Tianya’s passwords, and X is
the probability distribution of Tianya. In the CSDN’s op-
timal order, “123456” is the ﬁrst password. Given that
in Tianya’s passwords “123456” accounts for 0.52%,
p(CSDN)1 is 0.52%.

Using the methods mentioned above, we examine two
scenarios: (1) given the passwords from the ﬁve Chinese
websites as a prior knowledge, how well can we guess
the passwords of RockYou; (2) given the passwords of
RockYou, how well can we guess the passwords of the
ﬁve Chinese websites. Note that we did not take Yahoo
into consideration because of its small data size. The
results of α-work-factors and β -success-rates of cross-
site guessing are shown in Figure 4 and Table 14, where
we can conclude that cross-site guessing is much harder
than intra-site guessing (shown in Figure 3 and Table 13).
A lower β -success-rates means that the probability

of correct guesses given β guesses are lower. In cases
of using the information of Chinese passwords to guess
the RockYou passwords, the β -success rates (ˇλ5 to ˇλ10)
(listed in the 2nd and 3rd columns of Table 14) are lower
than the intra-site guessing ones, i.e., λ5 = 1.71% and
λ10 = 2.05% for RockYou.
In cases of using the in-
formation of the RockYou passwords to guess Chinese
passwords, the β -success rates (ˇλ5 to ˇλ10) (listed in the
4th and 5th columns of Table 14) are also lower than the
corresponding intra-site guessing listed in Table 13. A
higher α-work-factors means that it takes a larger num-
ber of guesses to hit the right passwords. Compared
with intra-site guessing (shown in Figure 3), for the same
α value, the α-work-factors of the cross-site guessing
(shown in Figure 4) is larger. Thus, cross-site guessing
is harder.

3.2 Guessing with Probabilistic Context-

Free Grammar

The PCFG-based guessing method [35] increases the ef-
ﬁciency of password cracking process by trying pass-
words according to a decreasing order of password prob-
ability. The key of PCFG is to generate password rules
(or structures). The rules can be constructed either from
passwords themselves or word-mangling templates that
can be ﬁlled in with dictionary words, for example. In
our experiments, we built rules from three sources: (1)
password sets, (2) dictionaries, and optionally (3) dates.
We chose to use PCFG to examine whether the afore-
mentioned rules are useful for guessing Chinese pass-
words, because it has been shown to be efﬁcient in pass-
word guessing [21][24].

observed to improve the efﬁciency of cracking Chinese
passwords?

To answer those questions, we created rules out of
three types of sources for the PCFG-based guessing
method: password training sets, dictionaries, and dates.
For password training sets, we generated the following
ones. Note that all training sets contain 2,000,000 pass-
words, respectively.

• RockyouTS: This training set contains passwords
that are randomly chosen from RockYou. This rep-
resents a training set that only contains English
password information.

• MRockyouTS: This training set also contains pass-
words from RockYou. However, the passwords are
carefully selected so that its distribution follows the
Chinese password distribution: 50% of the pass-
words are digit-only, and 10% are letter-only. This
data set helps to examine whether the structure of
passwords is enough to assist password guessing.
• RockyouDuduTS: Half of the passwords of this
training set are randomly chosen from Duduniu,
and the other half are randomly chosen from
RockYou. This dataset helps to examine whether
combined samples of Chinese and English pass-
words can assist password guessing.

• DuduTS: This training set contains passwords ran-
domly chosen from Duduniu only. This represents
the scenario that an attacker manages to obtain Chi-
nese password sets.

We are interested in two questions: (1) How important
are Pinyins and date formats for guessing Chinese pass-
words? (2) Given that an attacker is only aware of the
English password distribution, can she synthesize a pass-
word distribution utilizing the differences that we have

In order to examine the effect of Pinyins in password

guessing, we construct two dictionaries:

• EDict: This dictionary is a combination of the Dic-
0294 and English-Lower. Dic-0294 is obtained

from a password guessing website [3] and English-
lower is obtained from John the Ripper’s public
website [2]. EDict has 869,310 unique entries in
total.

• CDict: To form this dictionary, in addition to EDict,
we add 20,000 most frequently used Pinyins from
the ﬁve Chinese websites. As a result, the size of
CDict is larger than EDict by about 2.3%.

Besides Pinyins, dates also play an important role in
password guessing. Since dates are digits, we mod-
ify the rules generated by the PCFG directly. We add
20,000 six-digit dates and 20,000 eight-digit dates that
are most frequently used in the Chinese websites to the
rules. These dates are assigned with the highest prob-
abilities in the observed rules of six-digit numbers and
eight-digit numbers, respectively. In total, these rules in-
crease the number of six-digit and eight-digit rules by
about 15% for MRockyouTS and about 31% for Rocky-
ouTS. We do not apply these rules to training sets Rock-
youDuduTS and DuduTS, because they already contain
enough Chinese dates.

We used the above dictionaries and the modiﬁed rule
set to guess the passwords of CSDN, and try 10 billion
guesses per experiment.

3.2.2 Results of the PCFG based Guessing
As shown in Figure 5, the name of the training set is
labeled on the left. In the parentheses, EDict and CDict
represents which dictionary the guessing is based on and
Date means that we added the dates to the rules generated
by PCFG. According to Figure 5, we have the following
conclusion.

• Chinese Pinyins and dates play an important role
in guessing Chinese passwords. By adding 20,000
Pinyins into the dictionary, we managed to increase
the percentage of password guessing. For Rock-
youTS, from EDict to CDict,
the guessing efﬁ-
ciency increases by 13% and from EDict+Date to
CDict+Date, the guessing efﬁciency increases by
14%.
Furthermore, according to Section 2.2.3, more than
half Chinese passwords are digit-only. For Rocky-
ouTS, the guessing efﬁciency increases by 17% af-
ter adding dates into EDict and it increases by 18%
after adding dates into CDict. Last but not least,
under the same dictionary, adding dates changes
the percentage of guessed passwords of RockyouTS
more than that of RockyouDuduTS.

• If we use the training set RockyouTS and MRock-
youTS, the differences between the percentages of
guessed passwords are small (less than 0.45% in all
scenarios). This means that the distribution of pass-
word categories (e.g., letter-only, digit-only, etc.)
does not play an important role in password guess-
ing. It is the string patterns that make difference,
since Chinese and English users prefer to use differ-
ent patterns of digits and letters. Thus, using Rock-
youDuduTS, which consists both English password
and Chinese password patterns can help the pass-
word guessing.

In total, from EDict to CDict+Date, we increase the
guessing efﬁciency by 34% for RockyouTS. This guess-
ing experiment imply that Pinyin and date’s rules should
be considered in password protection in websites. E.g.,

4 Related Work

Although graphical passwords, biometrics and other al-
ternatives to text-based passwords have been proposed,
text-based passwords still predominate today’s Internet
due to its ease of implementation. A large body of re-
search has shown the characteristics of user-created pass-
words [14][16][22][23][31][29][15].

Morris et al. [25] described the history of the design
of the password security scheme and studied the pass-
word habits of 3,289 Unix users. Yan et al. [38] studied
the password memorability and security. They found that
users rarely choose passwords that are both hard to guess
and easy to remember. Howe et al. [20] studied the be-
havior of home computer users because home computer
users are more likely to suffer from various attacks, e.g.,
phishing [36], dictionary attacks [27], heuristic pass-

word guessing [35], or brute force attacks. Florencio et
al. [18] reported a large-scale study of Web passwords
habits. The study involved half a million users over a
three-month period. They found that on average, each
user has 6.5 passwords and about 25 websites accounts.
Kelly et al. [21] studied 12,000 actual passwords from
several perspectives. They found that certain passwords
policies which can improve the strength of user-created
passwords are underestimated.
In addition, a blacklist
of weak passwords improves the security of passwords
greatly. However, the aforementioned literature rarely
mentioned the password difference between different re-
gions, especially between Chinese and English users.

Bonneau [6] analyzed the language dependency of
password guessing. The results show that among all
Yahoo passwords, passwords created by Chinese are al-
most the hardest to guess. However, our experiments
show that (1) the passwords of both English and Chinese
users are similar in strength as shown in Figure 3 and
Table 13; (2) if an attacker is aware of the fundamen-
tal differences between two languages (as pointed out in
this paper), she or he can guess Chinese passwords efﬁ-
ciently. Moreover, our empirical study is based on two
groups of websites: ﬁve Chinese websites, and two En-
glish websites, which represents a larger and more di-
verse corpus of passwords than Yahoo data set in Bon-
neau’s work, and our corpus include passwords from
users that only speak Chinese, unlike the Chinese users
in Bonneau’s work who should be familiar with English.
Bonneau et al. [9] also investigated the lingering ef-
fects of character encoding on the password ecosystem
based on password datasets from Chinese, English, He-
brew and Spanish speakers. Comparing with the results
in [9], our large-scale empirical analysis in this paper
also shows that the strength of the passwords of Chi-
nese and English users is similar. Moreover, we ﬁrstly
quantitatively measure how an attacker can leverage the
lingering effects to crack more Chinese passwords.

In terms of measuring the strength of passwords, NIST
standards [11] propose to use Shannon’s entropy to esti-
mate the strength of a single password. Unfortunately,
this method does not work well. Bonneau [6][8] pro-
posed a set of metrics to measure the strength of pass-
words. These metrics are independent of what the pass-
words are, but depend on the distribution of the pass-
words. We modify these metrics to estimate the strength
of passwords across websites.
In addition, Kelly et
al. [21] used guess numbers to measure the strength of
passwords.

Guessing passwords has attracted much attention.
Narayanan et al. [26] discussed a password-guessing al-
gorithm based on Markov model. In this model, guessing
passwords is based on the frequency of each character.
Weir et al. [35] proposed a PCFG based password guess-

ing method. The PCFG generates password structures
in the highest probability order based on a training set
of passwords. Then, it generates word-mangling rules
and guesses passwords from these rules. This approach
provides us with an opportunity to examine the differ-
ences between Chinese and English passwords. In addi-
tion, Veras et al. [34] employed Natural Language Pro-
cessing techniques to understand the semantic patterns in
passwords, then cracked more passwords than a state-of-
the-art approach did.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst large-
scale empirical study on Chinese Web passwords, lever-
aging a corpus of 100 million publicly available pass-
words. By comparing Chinese and English passwords,
we ﬁnd that Chinese users prefer digits in their pass-
words. Moreover, Pinyins and dates also appear often
in their passwords. Leveraging these observations, we
show that by adding rules and Pinyins into the dictionary
for guessing passwords, we can improve the guessing ef-
ﬁciency of cracking Chinese passwords by 34%.

With an increasing number of password creation poli-
cies being enforced by websites, a direction for future
study is to investigate the status quo of the password cre-
ation policies in Chinese websites and to study the im-
pact of these policies on password statistics. Also, it is
worthy exploring the semantic meanings of the Chinese
passwords.

A Method to Remove the Copied Pass-

words in Tianya

Tianya and 7k7k have an unusually large number of
the same accounts (identiﬁed by email) with the same
passwords. Since the statistic features of these dupli-
cated accounts are different from the ones between any
other websites, thus we suspected that the attackers have
copied accounts from Tianya to 7k7k or vice versa.

To investigate whether the accounts are copied from
Tianya to 7k7k or vice versa, we performed the follow-
ing analysis. We ﬁrst divided all accounts from Tianya
and 7k7k into two groups: One group contains the
users who have the same accounts and passwords both at
Tianya and 7k7k, and the other contains the users who
do not. We call the passwords of the two groups reused
passwords and not-reused passwords.

After analyzing the compositions (e.g., digit-only
passwords) of the reused passwords and not-reused pass-
words, we found that the proportions of various compo-
sitions are similar between the reused passwords and the
7k7k’s not-reused passwords, but different with Tianya’s
not-reused passwords. As a result, we believe that it
is likely that accounts have been copied from 7k7k
to Tianya and we deleted the reused passwords from
Tianya.
