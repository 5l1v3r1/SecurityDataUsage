Abstract
Typosquatting is a speculative behavior that leverages
Internet naming and governance practices to extract proﬁt
from users’ misspellings and typing errors. Simple and
inexpensive domain registration motivates speculators
to register domain names in bulk to proﬁt from display
advertisements, to redirect trafﬁc to third party pages,
to deploy phishing sites, or to serve malware. While
previous research has focused on typosquatting domains
which target popular websites, speculators also appear
to be typosquatting on the “long tail” of the popularity
distribution: millions of registered domain names appear
to be potential typos of other site names, and only 6.8%
target the 10,000 most popular .com domains.

Investigating the entire distribution can give a more
complete understanding of the typosquatting phenomenon.
In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of ty-
posquatting domain registrations within the .com TLD.
Our methodology helps us to signiﬁcantly improve upon
existing solutions in identifying typosquatting domains
and their monetization strategies, especially for less pop-
ular targets. We ﬁnd that about half of the possible typo
domains identiﬁed by lexical analysis are truly typo do-
mains. From our zone ﬁle analysis, we estimate that 20%
of the total number of .com domain registrations are true
typo domains and their number is increasing with the ex-
pansion of the .com domain space. This large number of
typo registrations motivates us to review intervention at-
tempts and implement efﬁcient user-side mitigation tools
to diminish the ﬁnancial beneﬁt of typosquatting to mis-
creants.

Introduction

Thousands of new domain names are registered daily that
at ﬁrst glance do not have completely legitimate uses:
some contain random characters (possibly used by mis-
creants [23]), are a composite of two completely unrelated

words (possibly used in spam [17]), contain keywords of
highly-visible recent events (ex. hillaryclingon.com
for political phishing in 2008 [28]) or are similar to other,
typically well-known, domain names (ex. twtter.com
[27, 32]). Domain purchasers use this ﬁnal technique, of-
ten called “typosquatting,” to capitalize on other domain
names’ popularity and user mistakes to drive trafﬁc to
their websites.

Many old and new domain names alike do not ever
show up in search engines, spam traps, or malicious URL
blacklists, yet still maintain a web server hosting some
form of content. However, maintaining the domain reg-
istration, DNS, and web server expends resources, even
if these domain registrations do not serve an obvious pur-
pose. Investigating the purpose of domain registrations
in the “long tail” of the popularity distribution can help
us better understand these enterprises and their relation-
ship to speculative and malicious online activities. In
this paper, we speciﬁcally consider the hypothesis that
typosquatting is a reason for many of these registrations,
and scrutinize different methods for committing malice
or monetizing this behavior.

In the Internet economy, monetizing on user intent
has been a very proﬁtable business strategy: search dis-
play advertising is effective because relevant ads can be
shown based on user search queries. DNS is similar,
as domain registrations provide ample opportunities for
monetization through direct user navigation rather than
search. Domain name front running, domain tasting and
typosquatting domain names can all monetize this phe-
nomenon. 1 [12] According to [22], domain tasting was
nearly eliminated in the generic TLDs by the 2009 pol-
icy changes by ICANN. In addition, [12] reports that the

1Domain name front running is when registrars register domains that
users have been looking for in order to monetize on their registration
potential. Domain tasting is speculative behavior abusing the ﬁve-day
grace period after domain registrations in some TLDs. This liberal
registration policy gave refunds within a few days if the registrant
wanted, however this policy resulted in short domain registrations en
masse. ICANN has since changed policy, limiting the behavior [12, 22].

anecdotes about domain name front running by major reg-
istrars do not seem to hold. But typosquatting, the most
prevalent speculative domain name registration behavior
to date, continues apace.

Typosquatting wastes users’ time and no doubt annoys
them as well. As we show in Section 4.5, less than two
percent of all domains we identify as “typo domains” redi-
rect the user to the targeted domain, and the lion’s share
instead serve advertisements which previous research has
shown to be proﬁtable. [16, 26] These ad-ﬁlled pages give
no clear indication to the user that they have typed the
domain incorrectly; without a descriptive error, the user
may abandon their task rather than double check their
spelling. By monetizing these pages with advertisements,
the typosquatter does a disservice both to the user and the
victim web site. Protecting users from typosquatters can
lessen the damage as well as disincentivize typosquatting
by decreasing the squatters’ proﬁts.

If a typosquatter hosts a site that impersonates the le-
gitimate brandholder it is certainly malicious and in some
jurisdictions illegal. Such overt violations have been mit-
igated via legislation in the US and policy by ICANN
[15, 21, 30]. For example, Facebook recently extracted
a $2.8 million judgement against typosquatters imper-
sonating their website; this successful litigation should
serve as a strong deterrent against this form of malicious
typosquatting against entities with the resources to liti-
gate [18]. Several reports by commercial security teams
have cited typosquatting domains’ use in malicious cam-
paigns for quiz scams [8], spam survey sites [37], in an
SMS micro-payment scam [14], offering deceptive down-
loads or serving adult content [25], or in a bait-and-switch
scam offering illegal music downloads [29]. However, un-
til this paper, evidence regarding the extent of malicious
typosquatting problems has not been available.

Typosquatting has been studied in depth in related work.
In his ﬁrst paper, Edelman points to the typosquatting
phenomenon and discusses possible incentives for both
squatters and defenders [15]. Wang et al. include a typo-
patrol service in their Strider security framework that
focuses on generating typo domains for popular domains
and protect visitors from offending content [35]. Moore
and Edelman revisit the problem in [26] pursuing a more
thorough study of the original thesis of Edelman. They
explore various monetization methods and suggest inter-
vention options. They pessimistically conclude that the
best intervention options are hampered by misaligned in-
centives of the participants. Banerjee et al. [10] make
another attempt to design a typosquatting categorization
tool. Their method works well for a small set of sample
domain names. These analyses have focused on active
measurement of typosquatting sites which target the most
popular domains – considering no more than 3,264 unique
.com domain names. However, we ﬁnd that no more than

4.9% of all lexicographically similar name registrations
target these popular domains. While typos for the most
popular domains likely account for a signiﬁcant amount
of typo trafﬁc, it is unclear whether the long tail also
supports a signiﬁcant amount of typo trafﬁc.

Here we present a systematic study of domain name reg-
istrations focusing on typosquatting perpetrated against
the long tail of the popularity distribution. We design a set
of algorithms that can effectively identify typosquatting
domains and categorize the monetization method of its
owner. We also design and implement tools to improve
user experience by allowing them to reach their intended
destination. Although various user tools exist in the wild,
most are inaccurate and focus only on a limited set of
targeted domains. Our typo identiﬁcation algorithms com-
bined with the user protection tools provide improved
protection against being misled by typosquatting, even
when it is perpetrated against less popular sites.

Section 2 provides background on typosquatting and
the most common tricks used by typosquatters. Section 3
presents our data collection methodology and describes
our typo categorization framework. Section 4 presents a
characterization of the extent, purpose, trends, and malice
involved in the perpetration of typosquatting. We present
mitigation tools and intervention options in Section 5.
Section 6 concludes.

2 Background

Popularity attracts speculation, and typosquatting is a
showcase of this observation in the Internet ecosystem.
Typosquatting maintains its popularity even in the face
of the continuous effort to diminish its impact. In this
section, we present a general overview of typosquatting
and discuss efforts to protect legitimate domain owners
from speculation.

2.1 Typo techniques and monetization
Typosquatters register domain names that are similar to
those used by other websites in hope of attracting trafﬁc
due to user mistakes. The most frequent occurrences of
mistyping are those that involve a one-character distance,
also called the Damerau-Levenshtein (DL) distance one,
from the correct spelling both in free text [13] and in
case of domain names [10]2. In this paper, we focus on
typosquatting domains of Damerau-Levenshtein distance
one (DL-1) that are generated using the most common op-
erations: addition, deletion, substitution of one character,
transposition of neighboring characters [13]. We extend
this to include deletion of the period before the ”www”

2Although some researchers have found that for longer original
domains a small number of typosquatting domain names with larger DL
distances exist [26].

refer to as “candidate typos” or ctypos.

3.3 Typosquatting deﬁnitions
To deﬁne the scope of our work, we provide a concise
deﬁnition of typosquatting.
Deﬁnition 1 A candidate typo domain is called a ty-
posquatting domain if (i) it was registered to beneﬁt from
trafﬁc intended for a target domain (ii) that is the property
of a different entity.

It is important that both conditions have to be met
simultaneously. Typosquatting domain names are regis-
tered with the parasitic intent to reap the mistyped trafﬁc
of popular domains belonging to someone else. This in-
cludes parked domains serving ads, phishing domains,
known malicious domains, typo domains redirecting to
unrelated content and afﬁliate marketing. Arguably, these
conditions cannot always be checked with conﬁdence, for
example ownership information could be disguised3.

According to our deﬁnition, parked domains that do not
serve ads are excluded from our deﬁnition of typosquat-
ting, because they are not making any visible proﬁt from
parking. We still consider them as typos until it becomes
clear if they are performing typosquatting on the target
or serving unrelated content. Candidate typo domains
that are defensively registered by the original domain
owner are also excluded from typosquatting, because the
owner of the typo domain and the original domain are the
same. Although defensive typo registrations cannot be
considered as typosquatting, they are born as an unwanted
consequence of typosquatting.

We deﬁne true typo domains as follows.

Deﬁnition 2 We call the union of typosquatting domains,
parked domains not serving ads and defensive registra-
tions the true typo domain set.

Finally, all candidate typos that are at DL-1 from an
original domain yet have unrelated content are consid-
ered as incidental registrations, although they can surely
beneﬁt from the lexical proximity4.

3.4 Active crawling
We developed a set of active crawlers to collect additional
information about the ctypo domains.

that is the only indicator of ownership. This can only be marked using
manual inspection.

*.aexp.com

4Here we face another uncertainty presented by scam pages that
generate legitimately looking random content. We observed several
such cases for suspiciously looking webshops. We make a conservative
assessment and categorize them as other (O) in spite of their questionable
content

Whois crawler. First, we collect registration data from
the WHOIS global database. We restrict our crawler to
the thin whois information as provided by Verisign Inc.
for the .com domains. From the thin whois record, we
use the registrar and registration date information.

DNS crawler. We collect DNS data to explore the
background infrastructure serving these domains. Our
crawler queries separately for A, AAAA, NS, MX, TXT,
CNAME, and SOA records for each domain. The crawler
then tests for random strings under the registered domain
to infer whether wildcarding is present. Wildcarding is
the practice when a name server resolves any subdomain
under the domain belonging to its authority in the DNS
hierarchy.

Web crawler. We use a web crawler to obtain the
rendered DOM of each page, along with any automatic
redirections that take place during the page load. This
crawler uses the PhantomJS WebKit automation frame-
work to provide high volume, full ﬁdelity web crawling
with javascript execution, cookie storage, and page ren-
dering capabilities [20]. The crawler follows JavaScript
redirections even when they may be obfuscated or con-
tained in child iframes; it then reports the method of
redirection and the destination for intermediate and ﬁnal
redirections. We also collect rendered screenshots of a
subset of pages for manual inspection.

3.5 Clustering and categorization

Clustering. We group domains together according to var-
ious attributes obtained from available datasets and active
analysis. Our goal with this clustering is twofold: to iden-
tify typo domains that might have been registered for the
same purpose and to point to infrastructure elements that
host a large number of typo domains. First, we identify
domain sets that are at DL-1 distance from each other,
forming a cluster of typo neighbors.

Understanding the infrastructure support and the con-
tent of the typo domains is required to make an informed
decision about their real purpose. To characterize the
infrastructure support for typosquatting, we cluster the
candidate typo domains based on their registration and
hosting information. In particular, we identify the major
registrars and name servers (NSs) that host candidate typo
domains.

Domain features. We derive a feature set including
lexical, infrastructure and content features of the can-
didate typos as shown in Table 5 in Appendix A. We
selected the features after carefully considering related
work, collecting 40+ features in various attribute cate-
gories, and focusing only on relevant ones. To assess the
efﬁciency of the selected feature set, we perform a system-
atic evaluation based on manual sampling in Section 4.1

USENIX Association  

23rd USENIX Security Symposium  195

and we use the results of this evaluation as a benchmark.5
Among the chosen features, domain length is a key
indicator for typosquatting behavior as longer ctypo do-
mains are more likely to indeed typosquat on the original
domain they are close to [26]. Intuitively, the Alexa rank
of the original domain indicates that more popular do-
mains are more likely a target of typosquatting. Based
on the zone ﬁle, we are able to observe the ratio of ctypo
domains versus all domain names on a given NS and we
deem hosting a large of proportion of potential typo do-
mains suspicious for an NS. Similarly, if the registered
domain of the NS contains keywords indicating parking
behavior, then ctypo domains hosted on this NS are more
likely to belong to typosquatting domains. NXDOMAIN
wildcarding is used by major parking service providers
to serve ads for web requests regardless of the subdo-
main. It has been shown that NXDOMAIN wildcarding
is a precursor of suspicious behavior and quite often in-
dicates parked typosquatting domains [7, 36]. Thus, we
also consider it an indicator for typosquatting when the
page content matches some collected parking keywords6.
Finally, several redirections usually imply suspicious be-
havior, and we deem them important if the redirection
targets a registered domain different from the typo domain
and the target domain. The features we selected resulted
in a signiﬁcant improvement over existing methods in
identifying typosquatting domains across the whole range
of .com domains. We leave a more complex feature set se-
lection and parameter calibration using machine learning
techniques as future work.

Categorization. Using these features, we attribute ty-
posquatting to candidate typo (ctypo) domains by assign-
ing the tag typosquatting (T), not typosquatting (NT) or
unknown (U). Unknown is typically used when the do-
main returns an HTTP or DNS error which prevents suc-
cessfully downloading the page. We also tag the usage
type of the typosquatting domains according to the mone-
tization categories presented in Figure 1. We also present
the novel approach of categorizing domains based on
their monetization strategy. Hence, we tag ctypo domains
which do not redirect the user to the target site as parked
(P) without ads (not on Figure 1), parked serving ads
(PA) ( on Figure 1), employing a phishing (PH) scam
(), or serving malware (M) (). When redirection is
used, then the ctypo domain can be tagged as defensive
(D) registration (), defensive registration using afﬁliate
(A) marketing () in addition to the previously mentioned
categories. When a ctypo domain redirects to another
domain, then we tag it as other (O) (, ) no matter if it

5 Manually generated datasets are widely used as indicators for
malicious behavior; for example, the PhishTank phishing list is a major
component of SURBL, the leading domain blacklist. [2].

6Here, we improve on the techniques used by [7] and [19] to ﬁnd

parking services and parked domains

is a competitor or a completely unrelated site7. Finally,
we mark all uncategorized domains as unknown (U), a set
that typically contains unreachable domains.

3.6 Checking Maliciousness
To analyze how the typo domains are used, 12 black
lists are checked for an indication that the domains are
malicious. To check a black list, we look for anything
that was on that list during the ﬁrst quarter of 2013. A
“match” is a second-level domain match, since this is the
relevant typo label.

To perform a check, a superset of all the domains for Q1
2013 per list was made, and the typo and Alexa domains
were compared against that superset. For Google Safe
Browsing, due to Google’s technical constraints, the each
set of domains was checked using the provided python
client against data for May 1, 2011 to July 31, 2013. The
results are presented in subsection 4.6.

4 Analysis

In this section, our goal is to characterize the current state
of typosquatting. For this purpose, we use the .com zone
ﬁle as the most popular and versatile TLD for domain
registrations.

4.1 Typosquatting distribution
Experts believe that most newly registered domains are
speculative or malicious. Paul Vixie posits that “most
new domain names are malicious” [34]. The subset of
registered typo domains from the generated typo domains
is widely accepted as true typo domains ([26, 35]), and
[26] has shown that this assertion mostly holds for the top
3,264 .com domains in the Alexa ranking.

We believe, however, that this assertion does not neces-
sarily hold if we extend our scope to less popular domains.
In order to investigate this possibility, we ﬁrst perform a
manual sampling from various sets of the .com zone ﬁle
to systematically control the accuracy of typosquatting
identiﬁcation and also to provide a credible ground truth
for investigation. We conduct a manual inspection of
four thousand domain names because the typosquatting
deﬁnitions in the academic literature [26, 35] are very
crude. Moreover, we present our mitigation tool analysis
in Section 5, and in so doing also discuss the limitations
of existing defense tools that typically only focus on cor-
recting typos for a limited set of popular domain names.

7Determining domain competitors is beyond the scope of this work;
we summarized redirections to third-party domains independently of the
typosquatter’s intent. While these redirections might simply be to other
parked sites, any redirection away from the original site is a trafﬁc loss
for the original domain owner.

4.3 Presence of typosquatting registrations
Having designed an accurate typosquatting identiﬁcation
tool, we now study the existence of typosquatting in cur-
rent domains registrations. We ﬁrst obtained 4.7 million
ctypos targeting the .com domains in the Alexa top 1m
domain list and existing in the .com zone ﬁle using the
methodology described in Section 3. Recall, that we split
the original domains according to their Alexa rank into
the Alexa top/mid/tail categories.

Figure 5: The cumulative distribution of true typo do-
mains in ctypos and unique ctypos as a function of the
Alexa rank of the original domains.

The ﬁrst and foremost question is the extent of ty-
posquatting targeting the Alexa domain set. We use YATT
to determine typosquatting behavior and partition ctypo
domains into the categories described in Section 3.5. In
Figure 5, we plot the cumulative distribution of ctypo do-
mains as a function of the originals’ Alexa rank, and we
also plot the cumulative distribution of true typo domains.
We see that the number of true typos steadily increases

as the Alexa rank decreases, although at a slower pace
than the number of ctypos. In addition, we also plot the
cumulative distribution of unique ctypos and true typo
domains.

We then show the fraction of true typos in the popu-
lation of ctypos in Figure 6(a). We calibrated YATT to
make a decision about each ctypo and thus it conserva-
tively categorizes the majority of unknown domains as
not typos. For Alexa top sites, the fraction of true typos
is higher, but for lower Alexa ranks the number of not-
typo and unknown domains increases. This is consistent
with our benchmarking results in Figure 3. Finally, in
Figure 6(b), we present the typosquatting categories as
a function of the original domains’ Alexa rank. We ob-
serve that the bulk of the true typo registrations proﬁts
from parked domains with advertisements. The number
of defensive and afﬁliate registrations is higher for the
Alexa top sites, but then then the afﬁliate registrations
disappear as we head to the Alexa tail while the defensive
registrations persist. Finally, there is a signiﬁcant number
of non-typo domains incidentally close to the domains in
the Alexa domain list.

Projecting our results to the total number of .com do-
mains in the zone ﬁle, we estimate that about 53% of
them are candidate typo domains and hence 20% of the
total domain set are true typo domains. Based on our
results, we estimate that about 21.2m domains are true
typo domains in the .com zone ﬁle.

4.4 Trend analysis
We analyzed trends in typo domain registrations for a
period of approximately one year (from 2012-10-01 to
2013-10-15). We considered domains from four datasets:
domains from the .com zone ﬁle, ctypos from the .com
zone ﬁle, ctypos targeting the whole Alexa list and ctypos
targeting the Alexa top list.

For the purposes of our analysis, we use visibility into
the .com zone ﬁle as a proxy for domain registration. Be-
cause the actual registration and registration lapse events
are not visible to us, we use presence in the zone ﬁle as
a proxy for registration events. We deﬁne a registration

signiﬁcantly more time. This trend suggests that the in-
formation asymmetry of the typosquatting marketplace
is such that new speculators register old typos at a much
higher rate than random domains.

4.5 Typosquatting redirections
Now, we scrutinize the afﬁliate redirections via third-
parties. This third-parties can be legitimate brand protec-
tion companies, but more frequently they are typosquat-
ting afﬁliates collecting type-in trafﬁc from a large num-
ber of typo domains.

Domain redirections that lead back to the targeted origi-
nal domains without intermediate domains are considered
defensive registrations, as explained in Section 2.1. If the
redirection leads back to the target domain via a third-
party, then we call it an afﬁliate defensive registration. In
Figure 8 the ﬁrst graph shows that in the cumulative distri-
bution of third party landing pages, eleven domains (less
then 0.1 percent of all of these landing pages) get redirec-
tions from more than 50 percent of ctypos redirecting to a
third party domain. The second graph in Figure 8 shows
defensive afﬁliate domains, where the landing pages is
the original domain, but the trafﬁc goes through an inter-
mediate afﬁliate domain. 18 such intermediate domains
(1.3 percent of all domains) are responsible for more than
80 percent of defensive afﬁliate marketing. Even though
this set has a very small overlap with the non-defensive
afﬁliate domains, a small fraction of afﬁliate domains are
controlling 80 percent of the afﬁliate market.

Finally, if the redirection leads to a third-party domain,
that is away from the original target, then this is consid-
ered truly speculative. The third graph in Figure 8 shows
redirections to third-party pages with only one redirection.
Here the domains are more widely distributed: there is
only one big landing domain hugedomains.com which
receives trafﬁc from more than 21 percent of this type of
redirection. The last graph shows the cumulative distri-
bution of all afﬁliate domains participating in third-party
redirections with a non-defensive purpose. That means
that these afﬁliate domains lead away the users from the
targeted original sites. 41 of these non-defensive afﬁliate
domains (0.4 percent of all such domains) control the
trafﬁc originating from more than 80 percent of candi-
date typo domains. This means that, here too, a relatively
small set of domains control the majority of such trafﬁc
going to a few landing pages.

4.6 Maliciousness of Typo Domains
In order to test the assertion that typo domains are more
malicious than other domains, the candidate typo (ctypo)
and true typo (ttypo) domains extracted from the .com

Table 3: Google Safe Browsing results for domains in

were checked against a variety of available black lists.
These results are compared against the same test on the
Alexa domains. By using 12 available black lists from
various sources ﬂuctuations due to the idiosyncrasies of
any individual list can be controlled.

The Alexa top 488,133 .com domains (all the .com
domains in the top 1m) are more likely to appear on black
lists than the typos of them, either ctypos or ttypos. This
result is consistent across all 12 black lists investigated.
In each case, the Alexa domains are more likely to host
malicious activity. The percentage of .com domains from
the Alexa list on each black list is always higher than the
percentage of ttypo domains on the same list.

Google’s Safe Browsing list requires a different check-
ing method, due to their storage method. The list also
distinguishes between a match due to malicious content or
attempts at phishing. However, the results show a similar
trend. The Alexa domains are more likely to be purvey-
ors of malicious software. Table 3 shows the results for
Google Safe Browsing checking for any listing from May
1, 2011 – July 31 2013.

There are several possible causes for this pattern, and
several of them would be uninteresting. A possibility is
that there is a pocket of malicious activity using typos, but
that most of it is benign. The ﬁrst place to look for this
would be the name servers hosting predominantly typo
domains. There are 10 name servers for which most of
the domains they host are typos of other domains—for
these name servers, between 20-80% of their domains are
typos.

The typo domains hosted on these 10 name servers
seem to be even less likely to appear on a black list. The
average percentage of these name servers’ domains on any
of the black lists is 0.051%, and the maximum percentage
of typo domains hosted by one of these name servers on
any one list is 0.27%. Both of these numbers are below
those both for typos generally as well as the results for
the Alexa domains.

Figure 9: Intervention potential at domain registrars and hosting companies. We present the distribution of typosquatting
domains (a) as a funtion of the registrars and (b) as a function of the supporting NSs (while setting the x axis to a log
scale for better visibility)

these typo domains we found two interesting results. First,
out of the 6 name servers with the highest true typo ra-
tio, 5 have domains that are privately registered and only
citizenhawk.net is not, showing that the others are
aware that their monetization strategy is questionable.
Second, we found that on the average 24.5 percent of the
domains hosted by these NSs is in the top Alexa, which
is 2.5 time higher number than for the rest of the name
servers. This indicates that these name servers are more
effectively targeting popular typo domains than major
hosting services who are not focusing on typosquatting.
These hosting companies with an unusually high number
of true typo domains could be regulated to effectively
decrease the effect of speculative typosquatting.

Infrastructure intervention is promising if it can be en-
forced globally by ICANN on the supporting providers.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that such a global action
will emerge as this is counterproductive for the domain
registrars, and thus miscreants can always shift their busi-
nesses to negligent or accomplice providers who are ﬁ-
nancially motivated to assist their businesses. Registrar-
and hosting-level intervention remains ineffective against
spammers [23, 24] and it is unlikely that it will be effec-
tive against typosquatting. Registrars and hosting compa-
nies do not suffer from typosquatting, thus there is little
economic incentive for them expend resources to defend

for protecting their customers.

against it.

5.3 Mitigation tools
The last option to counter typosquatting is the application
of technical tools to reduce the impact of typosquatting.
There exist mitigation tools to this end, but most tools
suffer from either trivial errors or from small coverage of
typosquatting domains.

Related work. Wang et al. developed Strider Typopa-
trol, a tool to automatically discover typo domains of
popular domains [35]. They focus on a small subset of
the Alexa top domain list [1], phishing targets, and chil-
drens’ websites. OpenDNS [27] provides typosquatting
correction in their DNS services, but only for major TLDs.
A similar tool called URLFixer [6] was introduced in the
Adblock Plus advertisement blocking tool. The URLFixer
tool includes misspellings of top Alexa domains, but fails
to correct less popular domain names and includes some
short domain names leading to false corrections. Chen et
al. [11] develop a browser plugin to check typo domains
based on a user-customized local repository. Banerjee et
al. [9, 10] propose SUT, a method to identify typosquat-
ting domains mostly based on HTML properties. Finally,
the autocomplete feature of most major browsers can also
decrease the instance of typos, albeit only for previously
visited sites.

Initial tests show that most existing solutions are lim-

ited in scope (the most popular domains or most frequent
typos), in features (only TLD correction or HTML fea-
tures) or in the information used (search typing or local
browser history) and consequently these tools are missing
a large set of typosquatting domains.

The YATT framework. We developed a typosquatting
categorization tool, YATT, that uses an extended domain
feature set to provide accurate typosquatting identiﬁcation.
Based on the output provided by YATT, we implemented
three typosquatting detection and protection services. The
ﬁrst service is a typosquatting blacklist (YATT-BL) com-
piled from the output of one of the versions of the YATT
tool. As a DNS based blacklist, this access method is
quick and lightweight. The tool works similarly to major
domain blacklists such as URIBL [5], SURBL [4] or the
Spamhaus DBL [3] and it can be used to ﬁlter out typo
domains from live trafﬁc. The DNS server uses RPZ [34]
to efﬁciently distribute the typo list.

Second, we implemented a Firefox browser plugin and
a corresponding typo protection server to protect users
from typosquatting domains. Our plugin contacts the typo
protection server each time a user types in a domain and
raises a warning if the domain typed by the user is found
on the typosquatting domain list. The user is provided
with the option of accepting the automatic correction or
rewriting it to her needs. The typo protection server uses
YATT-BL DNS blacklist described above.

Third, we are in the process of implementing a YATT
DNS server for organizations that want to avoid typosquat-
ting yet do not want to expose their DNS trafﬁc to a third
party server. Using this tool, a company could periodi-
cally download an updated typosquatting blacklist and
query it locally.

6 Conclusion

Typosquatting has caused annoyances for Internet users
for a long time. Since users lack effective countermea-
sures, speculators keep registering domain names to target
domains and exploit the trafﬁc arriving from mistyping
those domain names. Existing studies of typosquatting fo-
cused on popular domain names and thus have only shown
the tip of the iceberg. Similar to traditional cybercrimes
like spamming or ﬁnancial credential fraud, typosquat-
ting has minimal transparency, allowing what may be an
unproﬁtable activity to continue because new entrants see
its effects and attempt to become proﬁtable typosquatters
themselves. Investigating such speculative, “gray area”
behavior longitudinally can give us insights which might
generalize to traditional cybercrime and cybercriminals.
In this paper, we performed a thorough study for an ex-
tensive set of potential target domains. We found that 95%
of typo domains are targeting less popular domains. We
designed an accurate typo categorization framework and

ﬁnd that typosquatting using parked ads and similar mon-
etization techniques not only exists for popular domains,
but a whole range of domain names in the Alexa domain
list. We showed that a large number of incidental domain
registrations exist with close lexical distance to the tar-
get domains. Our conservative estimates indicate that as
much as 21.2 million .com domain registrations are con-
ﬁrmed true typo domains, which accounts for about 20%
of all .com domain registrations. Additionally, we found
that the typosquatting phenomenon is only continuing to
thrive and expand.

The difﬁculty of categorizing typosquatting domains
partially explains the inefﬁciency of existing mitigation
techniques. Much like typosquatting itself, mitigation is a
gray area: one cannot easily classify a new registration as
an example of typosquatting based on the name alone. As
such, typo domains rarely appear on blacklists. To counter
this problem, we designed several defense tools that rely
on a broad range of features. We provide a typosquatting
blacklist and a corresponding browser plugin to prevent
mistyping at the user side. While typosquatting will likely
continue to exist, these analyses and tools may improve
user experience and further decrease the proﬁt available
to typosquatters.
