ABSTRACT
One advertising format that has grown signiﬁcantly in
recent years are known as Content Recommendation
Networks (CRNs). CRNs are responsible for the wid-
gets full of links that appear under headlines like “Rec-
ommended For You” and “Things You Might Like”. Al-
though CRNs have become quite popular with publish-
ers, users complain about the low-quality of content pro-
moted by CRNs, while regulators in the US and Europe
have faulted CRNs for failing to label sponsored links
as advertisements.

In this study, we present a ﬁrst look at ﬁve of the
largest CRNs, including their footprint on the web, how
their recommendations are labeled, and who their ad-
vertisers are. Our ﬁndings reveal that CRNs still fail
to prominently disclose the paid nature of their spon-
sored content. This suggests that additional interven-
tion is necessary to promote accepted best-practices in
the nascent CRN marketplace, and ultimately protect
online users.

INTRODUCTION

As the online advertising ecosystem has grown and
matured, publishers and advertisers have experimented
with many diﬀerent advertising formats. Although dis-
play ads (a.k.a. banner ads) and keyword ads (a.k.a.
search ads) are perhaps the most well known ad for-
mats, advertisers continue to experiment with new for-
mats like native, social, and video ads (including 6 sec-
ond mini-videos known as “bumpers” [11]).

One advertising format that has grown signiﬁcantly
in recent years are known as Content Recommenda-

tion Networks (CRNs). CRNs are responsible for the
widgets full of links that appear under headlines like
“Recommended For You” and “Things You Might Like”.
These widgets typically provide links to two types of
content: 1) recommended content from the ﬁrst-party
publisher (i.e., the owner of the website that has embed-
ded the widget), and 2) sponsored content from third-
parties. Advertisers pay when users click on the spon-
sored links, and the revenue is split between the CRN
and the publisher.

The growth of CRNs has been fueled by the com-
pelling services they oﬀer to publishers. First, CRNs
provide ready-made recommendation engines that help
publishers promote their own content to visitors. Sec-
ond, publishers earn revenue when users click on third-
party sponsored content. To put things in perspective:
the largest CRNs, Outbrain and Taboola, claim to serve
billions of recommendations per month to between 400–
550M unique users, and earned $240M and $200M in
revenue, respectively, in 2014 [9, 12].

However, CRNs have come under ﬁre from users and
regulators. Users have vocally complained about the
“click-bait” headlines that are often promoted by CRNs,
or by deceptive “bait-and-switch” sponsored links that
appear to be content, but instead lead to product
advertisements [9]. Some advertisers have even used
CRNs to openly advertise scams (e.g., get rich quick
schemes) [18]. Furthermore, regulators in the US and
Europe have faulted CRNs for failing to prominently la-
bel sponsored links as advertisements, and encouraged
them to change their business practices [7, 20].

In this study, we present a ﬁrst look at CRNs, includ-
ing their footprint on the web, how their recommenda-
tions are labeled, and who their advertisers are. We
focus on ﬁve of the largest CRNs: Outbrain, Taboola,
Revcontent, Gravity, and ZergNet. To study these ser-
vices, we crawled CRN widgets from 500 websites in
2016, including 289 top publishers (e.g., CNN and USA
Today) and 211 random sites from the Alexa Top-1M.
In total, we collected 130,996 ads and 53,202 recom-
mendations from ﬁve CRNs, which form the basis of
our study. Using this dataset, we make the following
key observations:

17Figure 1: Sponsored links with thumbnail images
from Revcontent.

Figure 2: Text-only recommendations and spon-
sored links from Outbrain.

• CRNs serve 2.5× more advertisements than rec-
ommendations per page, on average. Further-
more, 12% of CRN widgets mix sponsored and
non-sponsored links, which may confuse users.
• 11% of CRN widgets that contain ads do not have
a headline, and of those that do, only 15% include
words like “sponsored”, “promoted”, or “ad”. Fur-
thermore, although 94% of CRN widgets include a
nominal disclosure, the substantive quality of these
disclosures varies greatly across CRNs.
• Advertiser quality varies widely across CRNs. Al-
most 60% of Gravity’s advertisers are in the Alexa
Top-10K, while 40% of Revcontent’s advertisers
registered their domain name <1 year ago.
• The most frequently advertised topics on CRNs
include dubious ﬁnancial services and salacious
celebrity gossip. This conﬁrms many of the con-
tent quality criticisms leveled against CRNs in the
press [9, 17, 18].

Although CRNs have been criticized in the past for
the quality of their content, and for failing to promi-
nently disclose the paid nature of their sponsored con-
tent [7, 20], our ﬁndings reveal that these problems are
still widespread. This suggests that additional interven-
tion is necessary from industry trade groups and regu-
lators to promote accepted best-practices in the nascent
CRN marketplace, and ultimately protect online users.

2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED

WORK

We begin by setting the stage for our study. First,
we discuss the broader online advertising ecosystem and
highlight related work. Second, we introduce Content
Recommendation Networks (CRNs).
2.1 The Online Ad Ecosystem

The online display and keyword ad ecosystem has
been well-studied by researchers. Rodriguez et al. used
anonymized data from a major European mobile career
to study the mobile advertising space [21]. Similarly,
Barford et al. used crawled data to map out the on-
line adscape and characterize the footprint of major ad

networks [2]. Others have used controlled methodolo-
gies to examine the prevalence of behaviorally targeted
ads, and the features that drive targeting [6,10]. A long
line of work has focused speciﬁcally on documenting the
proliferation of tracking mechanisms used to fuel the ad
industry [13–15, 19]. Finally, recent studies have shown
that tracking data and revenue are highly skewed to-
wards the largest ad networks [5, 8].

2.2 Content Recommendation Networks

CRNs, also known as Content Discovery Networks,
ﬁrst appeared in 2006 with the founding of Outbrain,
closely followed in 2007 by Taboola. Today, Outbrain
and Taboola’s widgets are embedded on thousands of
websites, and both companies generate hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in revenue [12]. However, competition
in the CRN space is ﬁerce: there are many incumbent
services like Revcontent, Gravity, and ZergNet.

As the name suggests, CRNs are centered around
HTML widgets that recommend content to users. Pub-
lishers embed these widgets into their pages, and they
display two kinds of recommended content: 1) links to
content from the publisher, and 2) sponsored content
from third-parties. Figures 1 and 2 show typical wid-
gets from Revcontent and Outbrain. CRNs personalize
the recommendations shown to each individual to en-
courage engagement, although the speciﬁc mechanisms
used by each CRN for personalization are unknown.

CRNs allow publishers to customize the widgets in
various ways. This includes: choosing vertical and hori-
zontal layouts; using CSS to style the widget; displaying
thumbnail images or text-only links; and choosing how
many and what types of links to include (i.e., the frac-
tion of ﬁrst- and third-party recommendations). Pub-
lishers may also choose the headline that is shown at the
top of the widget. Figures 1 and 2 show three diﬀerent
headlines chosen by publishers.

For advertisers, CRNs oﬀer a way to promote content
across a wide range of publishers. Advertisers supply
links with accompanying text and thumbnail images to
CRNs, who then “recommend” these sponsored links to
users via their widgets. Advertisers pay each time their
sponsored links are clicked, and the revenue is split be-
tween the CRN and the publisher.

Controversy.
Recently, CRNs have been at the
center of two controversies. First, CRNs have been ac-

18cused of not properly labeling sponsored links as adver-
tisements, which may confuse and mislead users [9, 20].
For example, in Figure 1 the only disclosure is the tiny
text “Sponsored by Revcontent” in the upper-right cor-
ner of the widget; in Figure 2, the only disclosure is the
tiny “what’s this” in the bottom right of the box.

Non-uniform labeling of sponsored links is exacer-
bated by publishers’ ability to customize the CRN wid-
gets. This leads to webpages that mix sponsored and
non-sponsored links underneath misleading headlines.
As of 2014, Outbrain claims to have added more promi-
nent labeling to their sponsored links [7].

The second controversy concerns spammy links pro-
moted by CRNs.
In theory, CRNs are supposed to
be used for “content marketing”,
i.e., promotion of
blog posts, articles, videos, etc.
In practice, CRNs
have been used to spread links leading to spam and
scams [9, 17], which echoes similar issues on traditional
ad networks [22]. As of 2012, Outbrain claims to have
increased their pre-ﬁltering of content to eliminate spam
(causing their revenue to fall 25%) [18].
In contrast,
Taboola relies on users to ﬂag spammy content [16].

3. METHODOLOGY

In this study, we focus on ﬁve CRNs: Outbrain,
Taboola, Revcontent, Gravity, and ZergNet. Our goal
is to answer fundamental questions about these CRNs,
including: where do their widgets appear? How are ads
disclosed to users? and Who advertises on these ser-
vices? To answer these questions, we need large-scale
data gathered from CRN widgets.

In this section, we outline our data collection method-
ology. First, we discuss how we selected publishers to
crawl, followed by how we gathered data from each site.
Finally, we present deﬁnitions that we will use through-
out our analysis.
3.1 Choosing Publishers

The ﬁrst step in our study is choosing websites to
crawl. CRNs cater to large publishers by helping them
recommend their content to users (in addition to being
a source of ad revenue). Armed with this intuition, we
collected the list of 1,240 publisher websites that appear
in Alexa’s 8 “News and Media” categories in February
2016. Example categories include News, Business News
and Media, and Health News and Media. We crawled
all 1,240 websites to identify publishers that may em-
bed CRN widgets. We randomly visited ﬁve pages per
website1 and analyzed the generated HTTP requests.
Out of 1,240 publishers, 289 contacted at least one of
the ﬁve CRNs.

However, examining large publishers alone may re-
sult in a biased sample of CRN widgets. Thus, we also
analyzed the HTTP requests generated by all sites in
the Alexa Top-1M that we had collected for an earlier

1We only included pages from the same domain.

study [3]. Out of 5,124 websites from the Alexa Top-1M
that contacted a CRN, we randomly sampled 211.

We focus on these 500 publishers in this study: 211
randomly sampled from Alexa Top-1M, and all 289 from
our Alexa “News and Media” catgories crawl2. This
sample gives us a balance of top media and news web-
sites, as well as lower-ranked websites.
3.2 Crawling and Parsing

Now that we have chosen 500 publishers, our next
step is to collect samples of CRN widgets. To do this,
we manually developed a set of XPath queries that cor-
respond to speciﬁc widgets from our ﬁve target CRNs.
These XPaths serve the dual purpose of allowing us to
detect the presence of widgets in webpages, as well as
extract speciﬁc information from the widgets. In total,
we developed 12 XPaths, with most (7) targeting Out-
brain, since they have the widest diversity of widgets.
Two example XPath queries are:

• Outbrain: //a[@class=‘ob-dynamic-rec-link’]
• ZergNet: //div[@class=‘zergentity’]
Our crawler works as follows: we visit the homepage
of a publisher p, and then proceed to crawl links that
point to p until either all links on the homepage are ex-
hausted, or we ﬁnd 20 pages that include CRN widgets.
We also crawl one additional link that points to p from
each of the 20 pages, to add another level of depth to
our traversal. Finally, our crawler refreshes all 41 pages
(i.e., homepage, depth-one, and depth-two pages) three
times, to ensure that we enumerate all ads and recom-
mendations oﬀered by the CRNs [10]. The crawler saves
all HTML from traversed pages. The crawl was done
between February 26–March 4, 2016.

Deﬁnitions.
Using our XPath queries, we extract
speciﬁc pieces of data related to CRNs from our raw
HTML. This includes the number of widgets per page,
and all links in each widget. We label each link as rec-
ommended if it points to the publisher hosting the wid-
get, and as an ad if it points to a third-party (i.e., it
is a sponsored recommendation). We also extract the
headline of each widget (e.g., the “Trending Today” text
in Figure 1) as well as any disclosures (e.g., the “Spon-
sored by Revcontent” text in Figure 1). Note that not
all widgets have headlines or disclosures.
4. ANALYSIS

In this section, we analyze our dataset in order to gain
a better understanding of the CRN ecosystem. First,
we present general statistics about the online footprint
of CRNs and the functionality of their widgets. Second,
we examine the headlines of CRN widgets, and whether
paid sponsorships are being clearly disclosed. Third, we
brieﬂy look at how CRNs target advertisements based
on context and geography. Fourth, we investigate the

excluded pornographic sites from the samples.

relationship between ads and advertisers, and ﬁnally we
examine the content that is advertised via CRNs.
4.1 High-Level Statistics

We begin by presenting a broad overview of our ﬁve
target CRNs in Table 1. As expected, Outbrain and
Taboola are embedded in an order-of-magnitude more
publishers than their smaller competitors. We also see
that only 334 of our 500 publishers have embedded wid-
gets from CRNs, and yet all 500 request at least one
resource from a CRN (see § 3.1). The 166 missing pub-
lishers include trackers from CRNs, but do not embed
recommendation widgets in their pages.

Table 1 shows the total number of ads (i.e., recom-
mendations sponsored by third-parties) and recommen-
dations we observe from each CRN, as well as average
ads and recommendations per page. Four of the CRNs
serve more ads than recommendations; ZergNet is a spe-
cial case, since it only serves ads. Outbrain serves 1.5×
more ads per page than recommendations on average,
while Taboola and Revcontent serve 5× more ads on
average. Gravity is the sole exception to this trend:
we observe 2.7× more recommendations from Gravity
overall, and only ∼1 ad per page.

Interestingly, we observe cases where a given pub-
lisher will embed widgets from competing CRNs into
their website. As shown in Table 2, this situation is rel-
atively rare: only 36 publishers use ≥ 2 CRNs. The
Huﬃngton Post actually embeds widgets from Out-
brain, Taboola, Gravity, and Revcontent. Publishers
with multiple CRN widgets may be attempting to cap-
ture additional revenue by presenting users with more
ads, or the publisher may be conducting an A/B test to
compare revenue from competing CRNs.

Mixed Recommendations.
Most of the CRN
widgets in our dataset include ads or recommendations.
This makes sense from a user interface perspective: mix-
ing sponsored and organic recommendations in a single
container may confuse users. However, 11.9% of CRN
widgets in our dataset do not behave this way: the “%

Table 3: Top-10 headlines used for labeling rec-
ommendation and ad widgets.

Mixed” column in Table 1 shows the percentage of wid-
gets from each CRN that include ads and recommenda-
tions. We observe that Taboola, Outbrain, and Gravity
all allow publishers to mix ads and recommendations
inside a single widget, with 26% of Gravity widgets be-
having this way.

We manually examined the widgets with mixed rec-
ommendations and found that it was often unclear
which links were ads.
In some cases, the ads have a
small icon next to them that links to a disclosure (simi-
lar to the AdChoices
icon). In other cases, the target
of each link is stated in parenthesis (see Figure 2 for an
example), which explicitly informs the user that the link
directs to a third-party, but does not explicitly inform
the user that the link is a paid promotion.
4.2 Headlines and Disclosures

Our observations about widgets with mixed recom-
mendations leads directly to our next set of questions:
are CRNs explicitly labeling sponsored links as adver-
tisements? To investigate this issue, we examine the
headlines and disclosures in CRN widgets.

Headlines.
Overall, we observe that 88% of CRN
widgets have headlines. Of those that do not, 11% con-
tain ads. Table 3 shows the top-10 most common head-
lines for recommendation and ad widgets3, as well as
the percentage of widgets with those headlines. Sur-
prisingly, three of the top-10 headlines are identical for
recommendation and ad widgets, and none of the three
explicitly state that the links may be advertisements.
The most common ad widget headline also does not in-

3Many widgets have headlines that diﬀer by exactly one word,
e.g., “You May Like” and “You Might Like”. We cluster these
headlines together in Table 3.

20Figure 3: Average contextual ads per Outbrain
widget for diﬀerent publishers and topics.

Figure 4: Average location ads per Outbrain
widget for diﬀerent publishers and topics.

dicate the presence of sponsored links. Across all head-
lines for ad widgets, only 12% include the word “pro-
moted”, 2% include “partner”, 1% include “sponsored”,
and <1% include “ad” or “advertiser”.

Disclosures.
Besides headlines, some CRN wid-
gets include small text snippets, images, or links that
disclose the presence of ads (see Figures 1 and 2 for ex-
amples). As shown in Table 1, overall, we observe that
94% of CRN widgets include such disclosures. However,
this behavior varies signiﬁcantly across CRNs: for ex-
ample, Revcontent includes disclosures in 100% of wid-
gets, but ZergNet only includes disclosures in 24%.

Although it sounds heartening that 94% of CRN wid-
gets include disclosures, we observe that the substantive
quality of these disclosures varies widely. As shown in
Figure 1, Revcontent has the most explicit and uniform
disclosures, i.e., the text “Sponsored by Revcontent”. In
the 97% of cases where Taboola discloses, they also do
so explicitly by including the AdChoices
icon in their
widget.
In contrast, Outbrain’s disclosures are non-
uniform and problematic: some widgets hide the dis-
closure behind an opaque link (e.g., the “[what’s this]”
text in Figure 2), while others include an image stat-
ing that the links are “recommended”, rather than paid
advertisements (e.g.,

).

Summary.
Our ﬁndings reveal that the vast ma-
jority of CRN widgets do not explicitly state that they
contain ads.
In many cases, widgets do not contain
any headline or disclosure. When the widgets do have
headlines, they rarely include words that are associated
with paid promotion. Furthermore, Outbrain’s disclo-
sures merely reveal that the links are recommended, not
that the links are sponsored promotions.

4.3 Ad Targeting

Next, we investigate how Outbrain and Taboola tar-
get ads. We focus on these two CRNs because they con-
tribute the vast majority of ads in our dataset. Both
CRNs claim to use machine learning to recommend con-
tent that each individual is likely to click on, and reﬁne
their models based on engagement [9, 16]. Additionally,
both CRNs give advertisers some ﬂexibility to target
their ads: for example, we examined Outbrain’s docu-

mentation, and found that advertisers can specify geo-
graphic regions for their ads.

Context.
To get some idea of how Outbrain and
Taboola target users, we conducted two experiments.
First, we investigate whether the CRNs contextually
target ads. To examine this, we manually selected
four broad topics (Politics, Money, Entertainment, and
Sports) and eight top-publishers that 1) embed Out-
brain or Taboola widgets, and 2) have sections of their
websites devoted to all four topics. Next, we manually
selected 10 articles in each topic on each publisher (320
total articles), and crawled each article three times to
collect data from the CRN widgets.

To identify targeted ads, we compute the diﬀerence
between the set of ads that appear in articles in a spe-
ciﬁc topic and the set of ads that appear in all other
articles. Intuitively, ads that only appear on articles for
a speciﬁc topic are likely to be contextually targeted.

Figure 3 shows the fraction of ads from Outbrain that
were contextually targeted on each publisher, as well as
the fraction of contextual ads for each topic aggregated
across publishers (along with standard deviation error
bars). We observe that >50% of ads from Outbrain are
contextually targeted, with the Money topic seeing the
heaviest targeting.

We observe similar trends for Taboola: all topics see
>50% contextually targeted ads, with the Sports topic
leading with 64%. We omit these results for brevity.

Location.
Second, we investigate whether Out-
brain and Taboola target ads based on location. To
examine this, we used the Hide My Ass! VPN service
to obtain IP addresses in nine major American cities.
Using these IPs, we recrawled the 10 political articles
we previously selected on all eight top-publishers (we
focus on a single topic to control for contextual eﬀects).
As before, all 80 pages were refreshed three times.

Figure 4 shows the fraction of ads from Outbrain that
are targeted based on location on each publisher, as well
as averaged across publishers for a subset of our loca-
tions. We observe that only ∼20% of ads are location-
dependent, with BBC being the exception; we hypothe-
size that this may be due to the international nature of
their audience. For Taboola, we observe slighlty higher

These results agree with prior work showing that lo-
cation has a relatively minor impact on online display
ads [2, 10].

4.4 Down the Funnel

In this section, we analyze the advertising funnel,
starting with ads themselves, and ending with the pages
that users are brought to after clicking on the ads.

We begin by examining the uniqueness of ads served
by CRNs. The “All Ads” line in Figure 5 shows the
distribution of publishers per ad URL in our dataset,
i.e., on how many publishers did a given ad URL ap-
pear on? Of the 131K total ad URLs in our dataset,
94% only appear on a single publisher, i.e., they are
unique. However, this statistic is somewhat misleading:
we see many ad URLs that include unique IDs in their
parameters, which we suspect are used by publishers to
implement conversion tracking and A/B testing. The
“No URL Params” line plots the distribution of pub-
lishers per ad when we ﬁlter out URL parameters, and
we observe that the percentage of unique ads drop to
85%.

Next, we aggregate ads based on the domain name
they point to. The “Ad Domains” line in Figure 5 plots
the distribution of publishers per advertised domain.
We observe that unlike ad URLs, 50% of advertised
domains appear on ≥5 publishers. The total number
of unique advertised domains in our dataset is 2,689,
which provides a rough lower-bound on the number of
advertisers that were using the ﬁve target CRNs be-
tween February 26–March 4, 2016 (when we performed
our crawls). This ﬁnding demonstrates that the pre-
dominant strategy used by advertisers on CRNs is to
ﬂood them with many unique ads.

Table 4: Number of advertised domains that al-
ways redirect to other sites.

As shown in Table 2, 79% of advertised domains only
appear in widgets from a single CRN. We only observe
eight advertisers that leveraged four CRNs. This reveals
that advertisers prefer to work with a single platform
to distribute their ads.

Redirection.
Of course, just because an ad links to
a domain d does not mean d is the ﬁnal destination: d
may redirect the user to another domain entirely. To in-
vestigate the landing domains that users are directed to,
we crawled all 131K ads in our dataset. For this crawl,
we used a highly instrumented browser that records all
information about redirects, even when they are initi-
ated by JavaScript or Flash [1].

Note that when we visit the ad URLs, we bypass the
initial redirect through the CRN, meaning that the ad-
vertiser will not be billed by the CRN for our impres-
sions. We were able to avoid visiting the CRNs due to
a quirk in their implementations. All ﬁve CRNs embed
advertisers’ URLs into their HTML; however, they dy-
namically replace the advertiser URL with a link point-
ing to the CRN when a user clicks the link. In our case,
we do not click on advertiser URLs, and thus never
trigger the dynamic redirects. Rather, we extract the
advertiser URLs from the HTML and visit them sepa-
rately using our instrumented browser.

The “Landing Domains” line in Figure 5 plots the
distribution of publishers per landing domain. Surpris-
ingly, we see an increase in the number of unique landing
domains compared to ad domains (from 25% to 30%).
This reveals that some of the ad domains redirect users
to other sites. Table 4 shows that there are 466 ad
domains that always redirect to a speciﬁc landing do-
main, while 383 ad domains redirect to >1 landing do-
main. The ad domain with widest fanout in our dataset
is DoubleClick, which redirected to 93 diﬀerent landing
domains.
4.5 Advertisers and Content

Now that we have traveled down the advertising fun-
nel, we turn our attention to the advertisers themselves,
and the content that is being advertised via CRNs.

We use two metrics to as-
Advertiser Quality.

build up a positive reputation. Similarly, we would not
expect scammers or shady businesses to achieve high
Alexa ranks, which are based on visitor volume.

Figure 6 shows the age of landing domains in our
dataset, based on Whois records. We calculate age rel-
ative to April 5, 2016. We observe that Revcontent’s
advertisers have the youngest domains, while Gravity’s
have the oldest. Note that we do not analyze ZergNet
because all of the ads they serve point back to the
ZergNet homepage, which is simply a launchpad for
third-party, promoted content.

Figure 7 plots the Alexa ranks of landing domains in
our dataset. We observe the same trends as in Fig-
ure 6: Gravity’s advertisers have the highest ranks,
while Revcontent’s have the lowest.

The results in Figures 6 and 7 reveal that Grav-
ity caters to older, more established web properties.
Gravity is owned by AOL, and thus it is not sur-
prising that it tends to advertise well-known, AOL-
owned properties like aol.com and techcrunch.com. In
contrast, Revcontent serves ads for obscure websites
like Buzzfeed-knockoﬀ thebuzzstuﬀ.com. Outbrain and
Taboola fall somewhere in the middle, advertising a
small number of reputable properties and a long tail
of unknown properties.

Ad Content.
Next, we investigate the landing
pages’ content associated with 131K ads in our dataset,
to answer the question what is being advertised? To an-
swer this question, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) [4] to extract topics from our corpus of land-
ing pages. LDA uses statistical sampling to identify k
groups of words that frequently co-occur in documents;
each group represents a coherent topic. In our analysis,
we experimented with 20 ≤ k ≤ 100, but found that
k = 40 produced the most succinct topics.

Table 5 shows the top-10 topics extracted from the
landing pages, sorted by frequency. We observe that
∼20% of all landing pages are about the Mortgage or
Credit Cards topics, epitomized by words like “mort-
gage”, “credit” and “loan”. 19% of landing pages are
listicle-style articles (e.g., “8 Pro-Tips For Improving
Your IMC Review Scores!”). Other frequent topics in-
clude celebrity gossip, “miracle” diets, investment ad-

vice, and penny auctions. Overall, these 10 topics cover
51% of the landing pages in our dataset (note that
some pages may fall under multiple topics, e.g., a lis-
ticle about weight loss).

The results in Table 5 conﬁrm many of the con-
cerns about CRNs that have been identiﬁed in the
press [9, 17, 18]. Speciﬁcally, we observe that many
of the most commonly advertised topics are not “con-
tent”, but commercial oﬀers related to ﬁnancial services,
penny auctions, and medical services. Other topics are
“click-bait” centered around bombastic celebrities (e.g.,
Kardashians).

5. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst evaluation of Con-
tent Recommendation Networks (CRNs). CRNs have
become so ubiquitous that their headlines are clich´es;
indeed, we ﬁnd that CRN widgets are embedded in 23%
of the most popular publishers from Alexa’s “News and
Media” categories.

However, CRNs have also been a source of contro-
versy.
In 2014, Outbrain and Taboola (the leading
CRNs) were told by government regulators and indus-
try trade groups to prominently disclose the presence of
promoted links in their widgets [7,20]. Similarly, CRNs
in general have been repeatedly faulted in the press for
recommending spammy content and scams [9, 17, 18].
Using our dataset, we ﬁnd that these issues have
not been fully rectiﬁed. Only ∼15% of CRN widgets
have headlines stating that content is “sponsored” or
“promoted” (see Table 3), and only two CRNs in our
study (Taboola and Revcontent) consistently include
an informative disclosure in their widgets (see Table 1).
With respect to content quality, we observe that CRNs
continue to serve ads for dubious ﬁnancial services,
celebrity gossip, diet schemes, and penny auctions.

Our ﬁndings point to the need for further intervention
in the CRN market by government regulators and in-
dustry groups. At a minimum, CRNs should conform to
accepted best-practices like the Adchoices program, as
Taboola already does. CRNs could also make progress
towards correcting disclosure problems by making their
widgets more uniform, as Revcontent already does. Fi-
nally, CRNs could remove or restrict publishers’ ability
to customize widget headlines, and enforce clear labels
like “Paid Content”. We reached out to the ﬁve compa-
nies examined in this study via their public press con-
tacts, but none responded to our inquiries.
