ABSTRACT
Internet censorship artiﬁcially changes the dynamics of resource
production and consumption, affecting a range of stakeholders that
include end users, service providers, and content providers. We
analyze two large-scale censorship events in Pakistan: blocking of
pornographic content in 2011 and of YouTube in 2012. Using traf-
ﬁc datasets collected at home and SOHO networks before and af-
ter the censorship events, we: a) quantify the demand for blocked
content, b) illuminate challenges encountered by service providers
in implementing the censorship policies, c) investigate changes in
user behavior (e.g., with respect to circumvention) after censorship,
and d) assess beneﬁts extracted by competing content providers of
blocked content.

INTRODUCTION

Nation-level censorship affects the activities of hundreds of mil-
lions of Internet users, with many countries implementing it at dif-
ferent levels and for a variety of reasons [35]. While censorship
deployment and technology have seen considerable analysis in pre-
vious studies [9, 32], we lack a clear understanding of the conse-
quences of censorship: just how does its employment affect differ-
ent stakeholders? What steps do users, content providers, and ISPs
take in response to censorship? How effectively does a given act
of censorship achieve the censor’s goals, and with what collateral
damage?

While quantiﬁable answers to these sorts of questions have im-
portant socio-economic and policy implications, obtaining ﬁne-
grained illumination of these issues has remained largely unex-
plored due to the lack of datasets collected at appropriate vantage
points and at appropriate times (i.e., before and after censorship
events). Prior studies instead rely on datasets collected either via
active probing [32] or using proxy servers [7]. These datasets can-
not characterize individual behavior around censorship events; con-
sequently, prior studies have focused mainly on understanding the
mechanics of censorship technology and associated circumvention
possibilities, rather than the consequences.

In this work, we seek to provide quantiﬁed insights into the im-
pact of censorship on users, content providers, and ISPs, as seen
through the lens of trafﬁc datasets captured at a medium-size ISP1
in a major city in Pakistan. Pakistan provides a useful vantage point
for such a study as it recently instituted two large instances of cen-
sorship: blocking pornographic content2 in 2011 [5], and blocking
YouTube in 2012 [10].

The datasets we draw upon for this study comprise six residen-
tial and SOHO (Small Ofﬁce / Home Ofﬁce) trafﬁc traces collected
before and after the porn and YouTube censorship events, including
one dataset collected on the day when Pakistan blocked YouTube.
Trace durations range between 6–16 hours and capture sizes be-
tween 200–500GB, comprising trafﬁc from 100–1,000 local IP ad-
dresses.3 We supplement this perspective with a survey we con-
ducted of about 700 Pakistani Internet users.

While analyzing the captured trafﬁc traces, we developed
methodologies to establish the ground truth (what was censored
and how it was censored). Thus, unlike previous studies, our focus
is on the ofﬂine analysis of captured data to ascertain the conse-
quences of censorship. Our study develops the following insights:
• We observe a sudden increase in SSL trafﬁc on the day of
YouTube blocking, of sufﬁcient volume that we attribute this
change to users switching to VPN connections to circumvent
the censors. This change persists a year later.

• SOHO users very quickly identiﬁed effective circumvention
techniques, most of them switching to SSL within hours of
the content blocking.

• Competing alternatives to YouTube received considerable
beneﬁt from censorship. We observe a sharp increase (≈ 40–
80%) in trafﬁc volume towards these websites. Blocked sites

tiple users.

cal content. This change represents a marked regional shift
in the economics of video content distributors, who mainly
rely upon ad revenue.

• Before to censorship, porn content made up an average of
10% of home and SOHO trafﬁc volume. Post-censorship,
this fraction reduces considerably for both types of users.
Even after factoring in trafﬁc volume shifted to alternative
(unblocked) porn websites, and the contemporaneous in-
crease in SSL (potentially VPN) trafﬁc, porn trafﬁc volume
did not return to the same level as before. The apparent re-
duction of active demand appears to indicate that the censors
met their nominal goals.

• The YouTube block has two unintentional, yet signiﬁ-
cant, consequences: (i) ﬁnancial impact on ISP: as users
move to encryption-based circumvention mechanisms, the
ISP’s bandwidth requirement from the upstream provider in-
creases, since ISPs cannot in general cache encrypted con-
tent; and (ii) ﬁnancial impact on YouTube: user demand for
YouTube (in terms of video requests observed in unencrypted
trafﬁc) eventually becomes half of its pre-censorship magni-
tude, and shifts to other video content providers.

2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
This section provides context on the censorship events that we in-
vestigate, the issue of determining how censorship is implemented,
and the relationship between our work and prior research.

Internet infrastructure and censorship in Pakistan. Our study
spans traces collected at a Pakistani ISP between 2011 and 2013—
a timeline during which the country’s censorship policy evolved
considerably. There are ≈ 50 local and regional Internet service
providers (ISPs) in Pakistan [25]. Only two of these, Pakistan
Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) and Transworld
Associates (TWA), have direct international connectivity, which
they sell to the rest of the providers as well as directly to consumers;
note that the majority of CDN servers are located outside of Pak-
istan. Internet censorship in Pakistan has mostly targeted content
hosted outside the country, which Pakistani users access through
PTCL or TWA.

The directives to block a particular website originate from the
government or the judiciary. The ISPs are directed by the regu-
lator, Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA), to implement a content-
blocking policy. While Pakistan has been intermittently blocking
content since 2006 [32], a more persistent blocking policy was im-
plemented in 2011 with the censorship of porn content [5], and
then in 2012 with the blocking of YouTube [10]. The porn block
in Pakistan was instituted in response to a media report that high-
lighted Pakistan as the top country in terms of searches for porn
content [33], while the YouTube ban arose when a video, deemed
blasphemous, appeared on the website. Presently, the country con-
tinues to block access to YouTube4 as well as to sites deemed
pornographic, anti-religious, or a general threat to national values
and security [34]. A more recent study reports censorship of con-
tent related to human rights, independent media, proxy and circum-
vention tools, and bittorrent ﬁle-sharing sites [9].

Determining the implementation of censorship. Prior studies
have focussed on inferring technologies for implementing censor-
ship. Most of these studies use active probing to trigger censorship
4In early 2014, a US court cited copyright issues in forcing
YouTube to remove the offending video [36, 18]. As of this writing,
Google continues to ﬁght this order.

responses and comparing these responses to baseline responses in
uncensored regions. These studies seek to detect the manipulation
of trafﬁc by intermediate devices [26, 19, 39, 23] and to illumi-
nate the nature of censored content [11, 20] and the corresponding
technology and/or mechanisms [14, 4, 43, 13]. Some recent stud-
ies apply probe-based approaches to study censorship particularly
in Pakistan [32, 9], highlighting ISP-level DNS redirection, along
with HTTP-redirection and fake-response injection at the national
backbone. While previous work serves to help validate our ﬁnd-
ings, we cannot directly map it to our three-year dataset because
censorship mechanisms can vary (i) over time, and (ii) across dif-
ferent vantage points. We thus employ passive analysis of each
data trace to identify the censorship mechanism(s) in effect at a
given time. We are not aware of any prior work that reconstructs
censorship mechanisms by passive analysis of network traces, other
than within the broader context of detecting forged TCP RST pack-
ets [44].

Consequences of Internet censorship. Previous literature has
tackled the problem of how different network-level events, partic-
ularly in the context of anti-piracy laws, can affect the behavior of
users [1] and content providers [22]. In the context of Internet cen-
sorship, studies have assessed the (sometimes unintended) impact
of Internet censorship on global Internet services. China’s injec-
tion of forged DNS responses has been reported to cause large scale
collateral damage by blocking outside trafﬁc that traverses Chinese
links [3]. Upstream ﬁltering can block trafﬁc from outside a cen-
sored region due to ISP routing arrangements (for example, users
of an ISP in Oman could not access certain content due to ﬁltering
regulations in India [27]). Chaabane et al. [7] analyze logs from
Syrian censorship proxies to understand censorship methodology
and user behaviour. In the latter context, they ﬁnd that Syrian users
employ web/socks proxies, Tor, VPNs, and BitTorrent to circum-
vent censorship. Labovitz uses a combination of large scale crawl-
ing and third-party data sources to investigate how the takedown
of MegaUpload servers in North America impacts ﬁle-sharing traf-
ﬁc [28]. He ﬁnds that the incident caused a very small decrease
in MegaUpload’s previous trafﬁc share, but makes content deliv-
ery inefﬁcient, as ﬁles are now fetched from European servers over
more expensive transatlantic links. For our purposes, a limitation of
these latter studies is that from their own vantage points, they can-
not assess the full exchange of trafﬁc between users and providers,
and thus cannot analyze the possibility of intermediate censorship
(occurring closer to the user). Our study leverages an ISP view-
point to address this issue and investigates the consequences of In-
ternet censorship on users, content providers and operators. To our
knowledge, this last perspective has not seen previous study.

3. DATA SOURCES FOR THE STUDY

Our primary data consists of six network traces captured at a
Pakistani ISP5 between 2011 and 2013. As discussed in Section 2,
the government of Pakistan implemented two of the most signif-
icant and persistent policies in its censorship history during this
period. Figure 1 illustrates the temporal relationship of the cap-
ture dates to the censorship events. The traces provide both pre-
censorship and post-censorship snapshots of activity seen at an ISP
for two major censorship events. We note that our data is not nec-
essarily broadly representative, as it corresponds to just one ISP.

5The ISP requested to treat its name, location and other identifying
information as conﬁdential. The ISP originally acquired the data
for unspeciﬁed purposes, and provided a degree of access out of
good will.

Ethical Standards. The authors of this work with direct ac-
cess to the data signed a contract highlighting the obligations to (i)
respect user privacy, (ii) not share data with third parties (which
includes the other co-authors), (iii) not move data outside Pakistan,
(iv) not move data within Pakistan without prior consent, and (v)
undertake an objective study and refrain from maligning any party
involved in the censorship landscape (user, ISP, or government).
These restrictions did not affect our study in any respect.
3.2 Data Description

Table 1 characterizes the traces. Capture durations range be-
tween 6–16 hours and capture sizes between 200–500GB, com-
prising trafﬁc from 100–1,000 IP addresses. Some of these IP ad-
dresses likely reﬂect NATs, and thus the effective user population
could potentially range larger. Due to a number of variables in the
traces, a limitation of our work is that we cannot exclusively at-
tribute cross-trace trends to the consequences of censorship; these
might instead arise due to factors introduced by disparate cap-
ture days and/or timings. However, some of our results are sharp
enough that it appears very likely that they correspond to responses
to censorship. Finally, trace characteristics might differ between
traces despite similar trace durations and time frames because the
IP address preﬁxes allocated to a BRAS do not necessarily remain
consistent across traces.

Protocol Logs. Our analysis relies on protocol logs generated
using Bro [6]. In particular, we deal with connection, HTTP and
DNS logs. The connection log contains one entry per ﬂow, while
the protocol logs contain separate entries for each request-response
pair. We use number of connections to refer to distinct transport-
layer ﬂows and number of requests for individual request-response
pairs as observed in the protocol logs.
3.3 Data Sanitization and Characterization

For soundness of analysis, we ﬁrst identify measurement ambi-
guities/inaccuracies (sanitization) and then label the data (charac-
terization) so as to extract the portion relevant to a given analysis.
Data can include inaccuracies due to various reasons, where a
particularly common is the limitation of the capturing device or
analysis tool. A large portion of our data reﬂects connections that
did not fully establish (e.g., scanning activity). We remove such
connections from the bulk of our analysis (though we include them
when assessing evidence of user attempts to access blocked con-
tent). We identify unestablished connections based on Bro’s con-
nection state ﬁeld, which captures the sequence of control and data
packets seen for a given connection. We only include connec-
tions whose state reﬂects a completed three-way TCP establish-
ment handshake, which reduces our six data sets down to roughly
half the original number of connections, as reﬂected in Table 2.

To characterize our data, we label ﬂows based on the connection
direction and the type of local addresses involved, subsequently us-
ing only those subsets apt for a particular type of analysis. For

Furthermore, it is difﬁcult for us to estimate the actual user popula-
tion of that ISP due to wide usage of NAT devices.

We supplement this data with a user survey we conducted in
the region to explore user behavior post-YouTube censorship [45].
The survey results help shape the scope of our YouTube censorship
analysis, and provide additional perspective for our ﬁndings from
the primary data.

3.1 Capture Location and ISP Overview

Our tier-2 Pakistani ISP peers with a tier-1 provider through the
Transworld Associates TWA-1 submarine telecommunications ca-
ble in Karachi. The ISP caters to both residential and SOHO cus-
tomers. Due to our conﬁdentiality agreement, we cannot provide
details regarding the scale at which the ISP operates, the magni-
tude of its customer base, or the address space it uses.

Figure 2 shows the data capture location within the ISP premises.
All customer lines terminate at one of several Broadband Remote
Access Servers (BRASes) in the ISP’s network. Each BRAS con-
nects to the ISP’s core Internet-facing router through a switch. The
ISP gathered the traces at the BRAS-facing side of this switch. This
vantage point captures all of the local ISP-generated trafﬁc (such as
redirected DNS trafﬁc) in addition to bi-directional trafﬁc going in
or out of the ISP’s premises. The ISP assigns each BRAS to a set of
addresses. While the allocation remains unchanged for any given
trace, across traces the captures correspond to potentially different
subsets of the ISP’s address space.

Address Pools. The ISP splits its address space into dynamic
DHCP and static pools, primarily assigning dynamic IPs to res-
idential customers. The ISP reserves some static IP addresses for
hosting its services, such as DNS resolvers, mail and authentication
servers, and other web resources. It allocates the bulk of the re-
mainder to SOHO customers. We do not know which IP addresses
correspond to particular ISP services; in particular, we have no
speciﬁcs regarding its censorship apparatus, related IP addresses,
or blacklists in effect for different traces. Note that the ISP does
not allocate IPv6 addresses to its customers. While we ﬁnd some

example, to gauge the interest of local users in Web content served
over the Internet, we only consider outbound connections—see Ta-
ble 2 for an overview.

With regards to direction, we label a connection as local if it
has both source and destination IP addresses in the ISP’s network
block, or transit if neither source nor destination belongs to the
local network. We consider a connection inbound if its origina-
tor resides outside the ISP’s network and outbound if the converse
holds.

We further differentiate between residential and SOHO trafﬁc
based on the assumption that nearly all static IP addresses corre-
spond to SOHO users, where we determine the set of static IP ad-
dresses using information provided by the ISP.

Table 2 summarizes these characterizations. We ﬁnd that out-
bound connections predominate, followed by inbound, local and
transit, in that order. The small portion of transit trafﬁc agrees
with a communication from the ISP that we should expect a small
amount of trafﬁc from a sister ISP, along with some IPv6 test trafﬁc.

3.4 Final Datasets

Table 3 summarizes our ﬁltered dataset. We divide our six traces
into two datasets corresponding to residential and SOHO users re-
spectively. We use both datasets to study the impact of porn cen-
sorship, and the SOHO dataset for YouTube censorship, since the
post-YouTube censorship traces contain only small amounts of res-
idential trafﬁc. For a major part of our study, we work with HTTP
and DNS logs for outbound and local connections. We include lo-
cal trafﬁc in our analysis because we expect to ﬁnd a portion of user
trafﬁc redirected to local systems enforcing censorship.

3.5 User Survey

Finally, we carried out an online user survey targeting Pakistani
users in order to develop an understanding of their views of and re-
sponses to the YouTube block. (We avoided asking about the porn
block as it is a culturally sensitive topic in the region.) We dissemi-
nated information about the opportunity to take the survey through
mailing lists and classroom discussions. The survey asked about:
(i) the popularity of blocked content and new players that emerged
post-censorship, (ii) user inclinations to circumvent and the corre-
sponding mechanisms, (iii) collateral damage experienced due to
the block, and (iv) opinions about Internet censorship in general.

We did not expect many responses because it is hard to get users
to respond to surveys without any incentive, especially when the
topic is a sensitive one such as Internet censorship. Surprisingly,
we received 770 responses (75% male, and 25% female), reﬂect-
ing a widespread eagerness to comment on the subject. 94% of the
responders were young/middle-aged (25-40 years), and resided in
major cities, with occupations suggestive of high levels of techno-
logical competence. This demographic does not reﬂect Pakistan’s
makeup as a whole, and likely skews towards particularly informed
and active users. Thus, we do not frame its results as representative,

but rather as illuminating of some of the facets of how censorship
affects Pakistani users.

4. ESTABLISHING GROUND TRUTH

A signiﬁcant challenge for our study is that we use historical
data for which we lack key contextual information: (i) what was
censored (the blacklist for the porn block), and (ii) how it was cen-
sored (the mechanism of censorship). In this section we discuss the
methodology we employed to answer these questions based solely
on the information present in the available traces. We do so by an-
alyzing the responses we see from servers in reply to user requests,
basing our deductions on the observation that for enforcing cen-
sorship, a censor either silently drops requests or sends back false
response packets.

4.1 Censorship Indicators

A censor can block HTTP content at any of the layers involved in
facilitating an HTTP transaction: DNS, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Across
these layers, the censor has an array of choices for how to block,
each leaving a trail in the network traces. The presence of such
a trail (a sequence of packets not necessarily contiguous, or an
absence of expected packets) provides an indicator of censorship.
However, some of these indicators can occur in an uncensored envi-
ronment for legitimate reasons such as measurement loss or exces-
sive server load. We deem censorship indicators that can also occur
under uncensored conditions as ambiguous, and deal with them as
follows: (i) If the censored content is known, we attribute a high
frequency of an ambiguous indicator to censorship (and leverage
this information to establish the mechanism of censorship); but (ii)
if the censored content is unknown (that is, we cannot tie any given
ﬂow to an attempt to access blocked content), we cannot attribute
the occurrence of such an indicator over a short observation win-
dow (less than one day for each of our traces) exclusively to cen-
sorship. We therefore do not leverage these latter indicators, and
rely only on unambiguous indicators to establish (partial) ground
truth.

We now discuss assessing censorship indicators at each layer.
DNS Based Censorship. At the DNS level, a censor-controlled
resolver (such as one maintained by the present ISP) can effect
blocking behavior by sending: (i) No Response, (ii) False Error
(such as NXDOMAIN), or (iii) False Response (the RCODE for these
responses is NO ERROR). (Clearly, users can bypass these DNS-
based censorship mechanisms by using an independent DNS re-
solver.)

No Response provides an ambiguous indicator because it could
occur due to excessive load on the resolver, or network problems.
Thus, we do not attribute this scenario to censorship when the cen-
sored content is unknown. However, for known censored content,
observing a consistent behavior of no response is a strong indicator
of censorship.

Table 3: Final data after preprocessing. P=Porn, Y=YouTube

For the last two cases, we can leverage two public databases to
establish the ground truth: (i) dnsdb, which contains historical
information on name-to-IP address mappings [38], and (ii) Team
Cymru’s IP-to-ASN mappings database [40]. We identify false
responses as follows:

False Error: We mark the queries that consistently receive an
ERROR RCODE response from a resolver for a subsequent dnsdb
lookup. If there exists a name-to-IP mapping in the database for
the domain seen in the trace, we conclude that the censor employed
False Error as their mechanism.

False Response: We can detect a DNS resolver including false
IP addresses in its responses if we observe consistency in the false
answers returned. We identify whether a DNS resolver answers
with an IP address belonging to an ISP within the country (either lo-
cal ISP or an upstream transit provider from within Pakistan) when
the domain is actually hosted elsewhere. Let ASNtrace be the ASN
of an IP address returned in a DNS reply recorded in the trace, and
ASNreal be the ASN for the IP address received in a DNS reply
obtained by active testing. If ASNtrace belongs to an ISP within
Pakistan, while ASNreal does not, the query received a false re-
sponse. This technique has the limitation that we cannot detect
cases where the censor’s redirection points to an IP address that be-
longs to an AS outside the country. The same problem holds for a
censor who employs null-routing. Furthermore, this technique will
ﬂag caching servers employed within the country.6

TCP/IP blocking. IP-level blocking is an ambiguous indicator
of censorship, as it is hard to distinguish from legitimate causes
of inaccessibility. However, we can weed out some of the non-
censorship cases because censorship generally requires that all at-
tempts to establish a connection to a blocked address will fail. To
ﬁnd such IP addresses, we use the heuristic described below.

First, iterate over all the A records for queries resolved correctly,
and for each connection seen for one of these addresses, label it
according to the following three connection states:

• PARTIAL: No SYN seen from the connection originator, but

packets seen from the responder.

• EST: Full TCP establishment handshake observed.
• BLOCKED: The originator sent a SYN but either (i) re-
ceives no response, or (ii) receives a TCP RST (potentially
injected by the censor).

6Indeed we identify the ISP’s caching machines using this method-
ology.

We ﬂag IP addresses for which we never observe EST and for
which we observe BLOCKED at least once. We map these IP ad-
dresses back to their corresponding domain names in the DNS logs
and consider these domains as potentially censored.

HTTP Level Blocking. At the HTTP level, a censor can block
via: (i) No HTTP response (for example, by injecting a RST after
connection establishment), (ii) return an HTTP-level error response
code, or (iii) return a false response such as a block page (either
directly or via HTTP-level redirection). We assess these as follows:
• No Response: This can occur for legitimate reasons. We do
not attribute it to censorship when the censored content is un-
known. For known censored content, consistently observing
TCP-layer blocking can conﬁrm censorship (for example, the
case where the responder always sends a RST in response to
an HTTP request).

• Error Response Codes: This error can be ambiguous be-
cause a client can receive such responses due to resources
legitimately not found or forbidden. For known censored
content, however, this provides a strong indicator if it is the
dominant behavior.

• Block Page such as via 3XX redirection: The censor may
redirect diverse domains/sub-domains to the same Location.
We can detect this mechanism by analyzing histograms of
the Location header in responses. If, however, the censor
redirects attempted access for different content to distinct lo-
cations (such as by incorporating the request URI into the
redirect location), the histogram will not reveal any common
redirection target. In this case, the analysis in the next item
might reveal blocking.

• Block Page via 2XX response: We can detect when the cen-
sor sends the same block page for multiple URLs by ﬁnger-
printing block pages known to be associated with the cen-
sor, or by looking for potential candidates by investigating
spikes/modes in a histogram of the number of bytes sent in
server reply items.

4.2 Identifying YouTube Censorship

Table 4 shows our ﬁndings for deducing the mechanism of
YouTube censorship in Pakistan at the two different points in time
that are currently under study.

First, we observe DNS redirection in both traces for queries re-
solved using the ISP’s DNS resolvers: all YouTube queries received

replies with a single ISP-owned address. Queries sent to non-ISP
resolvers obtained correct answers. Second, we do not ﬁnd IP
blocking in either trace. We see only one potentially blocked ad-
dress in 18Sep12, which reverse-maps to a YouTube content server.
Finally, in addition to DNS-based blocking, we also observe
HTTP-level blocking in both traces. In 18Sep12, we ﬁnd block-
ing of YouTube via 3XX redirection to an IP owned by a large
local provider, one of the two with direct international connec-
tivity.
In 02Aug13, the blocking shifted from redirection to No
Response.
In traces before 02Aug13 (including pre-YouTube-
censorship traces), the number of YouTube HTTP requests that re-
ceived no response averaged ≈ 2%, whereas in 02Aug13 this num-
ber jumps to ≈ 95%, with nearly all of these reset by the responder.
These observations conﬁrm the two-layered censorship mecha-
nism for YouTube described by a prior study [32], i.e., ISPs block
locally using DNS redirection, and the two large providers in the
country with direct international connectivity (PTCL and TWA)
employ HTTP-level blocking.
4.3

Identifying Porn Censorship

To accurately identify porn censorship, we characterize all web-
sites recorded in our traces using McAfee’s URL categorization
service [30] and extract the ones it labels as Pornography. We
spot-checked a random sample of its decisions (both positive and
negative) to conﬁrm its apparent accuracy and lack of any regional
lacuna. We did not ﬁnd any errors.

In recovering the censor’s porn blacklist, we worked on each
trace in turn. Recovered blacklists necessarily represent only a frac-

tion of the censor’s true blacklist, since our data-driven approach
can only identify the fraction of censored content present in our
traces.

We aim to recover to blacklists at the granularity of registered
domains, per the master list kept by Mozilla [31], since later in
our analysis we use that granularity for characterizing trafﬁc to
blacklisted domains. Where applicable, we mark domains in our
blacklist as partially blocked. We consider the possibility of partial
blocking of a domain only at IP-level (due to incomplete IP address
coverage) and HTTP-level (due to incomplete regex coverage). For
DNS, we assume that the true blacklist contains domains at the
granularity of registered domains. Hence, we only add a domain to
our blacklist if we observe consistent blocking behavior for all of
its subdomains that appear in the respective trace.

Table 4 summarizes the mechanisms used for censorship for the
4 post-porn censorship traces. Table 5 shows the corresponding
development of blacklist. We observe the following:

• We ﬁnd evidence of DNS redirection in all four traces.
All ISP resolvers consistently redirect blocked queries to
the same ISP-owned address (the same address as used for
YouTube censorship). However, non-ISP resolvers resolve
the blocked content queries correctly, indicating that the cen-
sor does not employ DNS injection such as discussed by
Duan et al. [17]. Table 5 lists the number of blacklisted do-
mains per trace that we recover using this indicator.

• We also observe IP blocking for some porn domains. Since
this is an ambiguous indicator, we check for any overlap of
potential censored domains we ﬁnd using IP blocking with
those found via DNS blocking. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant evidence
of IP based blocking only in 18Sep12, with a 41% overlap
with our DNS blacklist. The TCP state of these connec-
tions indicates that the originator never received any response
packet from the responder, consistent with blackholing.

• We did not ﬁnd any instances of users receiving an HTTP
block-page either through injection or redirection. Some do-
mains consistently receive no response, but with negligible
overlap with our DNS blacklist, except for the last trace, as
shown in Table 5. The TCP states of these connections reveal
that in a high percentage of the cases, the responder termi-
nated the connection by sending a RST, indicative of likely
censorship.

Based on the above observations, we do not ﬁnd concrete evi-
dence of extensive IP- or HTTP-level blocking for porn, except for
the cases where we observe a high overlap with our DNS blacklist.
Accordingly, we do not include these ambiguous domains in our
blacklist reconstruction. Doing so omits only a handful of poten-
tially blocked domains.

Table 6 illustrates how the porn blacklist evolved over time. We
can in addition consider the question of whether the censoring au-
thority acts in a reactive fashion; that is, do they block porn do-
mains that begin to gain popularity with users? In pre-block traces
(03Oct11 and 22Oct11), we see 1,313 unique porn domains. We
ﬁnd that 8.2% of these domains were blocked in 21Dec11. After
the initial dissemination of the blacklist in 21Dec11, we see a lull in
its updating; we observe only ≈ 35 new domains added in each of
28Feb12 and 18Sep12, and no new ones in the last trace. Moreover,
the “new” blocked domains have little overlap with porn domains
previously observed and unblocked—reinforcing information un-
ofﬁcially shared with us by local operators that the central regu-
lator disseminates blacklists to ISPs and that their development is
independent of the porn browsing trends of users. (Section 2).

276Summary. Table 4 summarizes our ﬁndings on the mechanism
of censorship for YouTube and porn as seen in different traces. We
ﬁnd blocking of both YouTube and porn at the DNS-level using
redirection in all of the respective post-block traces. In addition,
in 18Sep12 we ﬁnd YouTube blocked using HTTP redirection, and
porn using IP blocking, and in 02Aug13 both are blocked using
RST injection.

5. METRICS RELEVANT TO CONTENT

PROVIDERS

In this section we discuss two key aspects for our study: (i) what
constitutes a “content provider” relative to each censorship event,
and (ii) the metrics on which we base our assessment of changes
resulting from censorship events (note that we can only apply these
metrics to unencrypted trafﬁc).

Censorship events affect both primary and alternate providers
of the censored content. For the YouTube event, these relate to
the general category of Video Content Platforms, for which we fo-
cus our analysis on four major players: YouTube, DailyMotion,
Tune.pk and Vimeo. These constitute the primary video providers
for Pakistan as based on their market share [2] and the results of
our user survey [45]. For the porn censorship event, we consider
all porn domains seen in our traces as identiﬁed by McAfee’s URL
categorization service in April 2014. Given that our most recent
trace was captured in August 2013, some domains might have been
inaccurately classiﬁed.

The primary metric that we employ is downstream trafﬁc (server
response bytes) served by blocked and alternate content providers,
which we will often abbreviate as “bandwidth” for shorthand. We
base this choice on the observation that both the censored cate-
gories, video and porn, make heavy use of network downloads—
what is censored primarily constitutes images and videos. For these
categories, downstream bandwidth reasonably captures the degree
of user interest in a content provider. This metric also allows us to
readily study shifts in trafﬁc trends in the presence of encryption
technologies—a potential response to broad category-based cen-
sorship.

In addition, for the video category we assess changes in con-
tent embedded in other sites in response to censorship.7 This met-
ric captures the broader ecosystem for users viewing videos some-
times in response to other websites that embed a content provider’s
videos. (Porn content, on the other hand, is presumably only em-
bedded on other porn sites.) After censorship of a content provider,
local websites lack an incentive to embed the provider’s videos.

We now discuss computing these two metrics:
(i) Direct vs. embedded video viewing requests: To distinguish
between these two types of requests, we need to develop signatures
that classify a given URL as one or the other (or neither) of these.
One approach for developing signatures is to analyze trafﬁc dumps
collected by actively downloading video content [24]. However,
given we collected our traces over a span of three years, we cannot
employ an active approach like this, as signatures can change over
the years. To develop signatures that can span our datasets, we use
a data-driven methodology: for each video content platform, we
examine a histogram of its URI root preﬁxes and associate them
with distinct classes of web content based on inspecting the cor-
responding content type observed in trafﬁc captures, and in some
cases entering the full URL into a browser to see if the video plays.

7Note that we treat links to a content provider’s page returned in
search results as a form of direct access, rather than “embedded”
access, because we presume that often users navigate to such pages
via search engines.

This approach provides us with ﬁngerprints for both direct and em-
bedded viewing request URLs for each video content platform. We
note that direct and embedded video watching requests have a con-
sistent signature across traces, perhaps because these span the same
domain.

(ii) Bandwidth per content provider: We could compute
downstream bandwidth by accumulating server bytes for all HTTP
requests where the content provider domain appears in the Host
header. However, this approach risks missing trafﬁc because: (i)
content can be served by CDNs (often the case for videos and
images), the domain name of which may have no relationship to
the host corresponding to the original video/image request, and (ii)
CDNs typically serve content on behalf of multiple domains, mak-
ing it infeasible to exclusively associate a given CDN domain with a
speciﬁc origin server. We might consider accounting for such trafﬁc
by accumulating all response bytes for requests where the content
provider appears in Referer, but doing so will: (i) include bytes
belonging to other websites/providers, since the Referer might
instead reﬂect the user clicking on a link on the original content
provider page that leads to a different content provider’s page, and
(ii) miss bytes belonging to the content provider in cases where an
automatic chain of requests traverses multiple domains in order to
ultimately reach the CDN.

Putting the above considerations together, we employ the follow-

ing approaches for estimating trafﬁc volume:

• Video Content Platforms: Because these analyses concern
just a handful of content providers, for the video cate-
gory it remains practical to develop URI signatures for
each of the four major players. Note that these signa-
tures are different than the direct and embedded watch
signatures, because the video is in general fetched from
a URL different
than that of the watch page. Along
with analysis of active fetches, we analyze all HTTP re-
quests where either Host or Referer contains the con-
tent provider’s domain, and the Content-Type header in
the response is either application/octet-stream or
contains the keyword “video”.
It follows that we miss
video downloads for content providers whose domain name
appears in neither the Host nor the Referer part of an
HTTP request. We ﬁnd that YouTube transfers video us-
ing both video and application/octet-stream.
The other three providers, however, only transfer video
using a video content-type (and sometimes employ
application/octet-stream for content such as CSS
and fonts).

• Porn Providers: Accurately attributing porn bandwidth re-
quires a more generic approach, since there are too many
providers (≈ 3,800 seen in our traces) to allow us to craft
individual signatures. Since a porn site can embed content
from other porn sites, when we see a transfer for which both
the Host domain and the Referer domain are labeled as
porn in our dataset, we give priority to the former. Speciﬁ-
cally, we use the rule: if Host has porn domain X, add the
corresponding bytes to X; else if Referer exists and has a
porn domain Y , add corresponding bytes to Y . Otherwise,
do not attribute the transfer to any domain.

6. CHANGES IN USER BEHAVIOR

The intrusive nature of Internet censorship will naturally lead
to some users altering their behavior in its aftermath. In this sec-
tion we quantify several perspectives regarding user demand for

blocked content before censorship, and their persistence and ap-
proaches in accessing blocked content after censorship comes into
place. While we cannot rule out other factors leading to some of
the changes we have observed, the broad scope of the censorship
events we consider makes it quite likely that our observations in-
deed reﬂect responses to censorship.

6.1 Changes in Trafﬁc

For video trafﬁc, we observe in Table 7(a) that on average
video trafﬁc comprised 50% of HTTP trafﬁc before the YouTube
block, consistent with global trends (videos comprised 57% of
user-generated trafﬁc in 2012 [8]). The overall (unencrypted) video
consumption rate drastically declines after the YouTube block, sub-
sequently comprising only 12% of total HTTP trafﬁc in 18Sep12,
and declining further to 5.5% in 02Aug13. The decline in video
trafﬁc coincides with a decrease of nearly 90% in the HTTP to

SSL8 ratio in 18Sep12, corresponding to the YouTube block day.
The ratio remained fairly consistent on this day as viewed hour-
to-hour (on average ≈ 3.25), indicating that SOHO users quickly
switched to SSL-based circumvention technologies. The trace for
this day does not reﬂect a clear learning phase, suggesting such had
already occurred by the time the capture began. The overall trend
for SSL trafﬁc remained consistent 11 months later in 02Aug13.
This steep increase in SSL trafﬁc post-YouTube-block highlights
that most users likely use encrypted tunnels to watch video content
after the block. As we note below, the SSL trafﬁc heavily corre-
lates with the use of proxy services, suggesting that it indeed arises
due to employment of circumvention measures. Our user study
substantiates this conjecture: 57% of the survey participants state
they used SSL-based VPN software (UltraSurf, OpenVPN, Hotspot
Shield) to access YouTube content.

If we look at direct video requests (either via user navigation,
or mediated by clicking on search results), per Table 8(b) we ﬁnd
that the vast majority of direct video requests prior to the block
correspond to YouTube (average 98%).
Immediately after block
(18Sep12), YouTube still receives the highest portion (though re-
duced by 27%) of direct requests, but the proportion sharply drops
11 months later in 02Aug13 to 46%, with users dispersing the rest
of the requests among alternate providers. The decrease in direct
YouTube video requests matches our survey results: 40% of re-
spondents mentioned that they do not bother to click on YouTube
links due to the blocking; 39% will access the link using a circum-
vention mechanism; while 17% access the video via an alternate
provider.

Table 7 shows that before the blocking, the average porn band-
width ranged from 8.4–11.5% for residential and SOHO users, re-
spectively. These numbers lie below global estimates that porn
comprises 30% of Internet trafﬁc [21]. That we ﬁnd more porn
bandwidth consumed at SOHOs than at homes likely occurs be-
cause of higher bandwidths available in SOHO networks. After

8We cannot conclusively say if the SSL trafﬁc corresponds to VPNs
or HTTPS.

the block, the residential porn bandwidth falls by more than half
(averaging 3.7% of HTTP bandwidth post-block).

For SOHO trafﬁc, the average porn bandwidth reduces by a fac-
tor of three. In contrast to video, we do not observe a signiﬁcant
increase in the HTTP-to-SSL trafﬁc ratio in response to porn cen-
sorship, indicating a subset of users either stopped watching porn
or shifted to alternate porn providers.9.
6.2 Impact on User Behavior

Censorship can potentially modify the network behavior of users
or result in new behavior driven by trying to access blocked content.
In this section we assess this possibility by examining the usage of
DNS resolvers and web proxies over time, along with a look at user
browsing activities immediately after encountering the block page.

DNS resolvers. For both censorship events we study, the censor
employed DNS redirection by local ISP resolvers as the primary
means of censorship enforcement. Circumvention to counter this
step only requires using an alternate DNS resolver. Table 9 illumi-
nates the degree to which users pursued this option by examining
the top-5 DNS resolvers used to resolve DNS A or AAAA queries
across the six traces.10 We ﬁnd that prior to censorship, local ISP
servers resolved at least 90% of queries for both categories. Post-
porn censorship, we observe a small increase (≈ 5%) in queries
resolved by Google’s public DNS resolvers, with a correspond-
ing decrease in queries resolved by the ISP. This number rises to
≈ 13% in post-YouTube censorship traces. At the same time, the
queries resolved by local ISP servers drops to 70%, and we see an
increase in queries resolved by OpenDNS and LEVEL-3. The use
of alternate DNS resolvers to circumvent censorship has appeared
in other censorship incidents [37], and potentially increases user
exposure to security risks [12].

Web proxies.

For each trace we identify unique domains
in HTTP requests labeled by McAfee’s categorization service as
Anonymizers. For SOHO trafﬁc, we observe only 1 web proxy

in our additional

9For SOHO trafﬁc,
traces (18Sep12 and
02Aug13) the SSL ratio increases by several orders of magnitude;
however this may instead reﬂect the YouTube censorship that spans
this same timeline.
10To eliminate bias due to automated DNS queries that might po-
tentially use a diverse set of DNS resolvers, we limit our analysis
to queries for the blocked categories, as these unlikely are due to
non-human actors.

prior to the YouTube block, which rises to an average of 41 prox-
ies post-block, with a striking 114 proxies on the day of the block.
Residential trafﬁc shares the same pre-block distribution of web
proxies as SOHO trafﬁc, though with a less dramatic increase
post-block (11.5% on average). From domains extracted from
SSL certiﬁcates, we ﬁnd no proxy hosts in traces prior to the
YouTube block, but after the block we observe 15 and 8 unique
proxy hosts (18Sep12 and 02Aug13, respectively). These hosts
either operate encrypted by default or provide an easy option for
encryption, as conﬁrmed through manual analysis. For example,
the top two, youtubeproxy.org and 12345proxy.net, use
HTTPS by default, and another popular one, 4everproxy.com
lists HTTPS-based proxies prominently on its home page. In addi-
tion, the respondents to our survey indicated that SSL-based soft-
ware such as OpenVPN and Hotspot Shield are among the most
popular circumvention tools. Apparently these tools grew in popu-
larity during the year between our last trace and our survey, as we
did not ﬁnd dominant usage trends for either in our data.

User behavior after viewing block page. We can also gain in-
sight into how users responded to censorship by analyzing their
actions after encountering a block page: in particular, whether they
then attempt to access similar unblocked content, attempt to em-
ploy circumvention, or apparently give up (shift to some other form
of activity).

We assess this as follows: for each user encountering a block
page, we analyze their HTTP transactions in the subsequent 5-
minute window. To reduce ambiguities due to IP aliasing, we con-
ﬁne this analysis to activity from the same address that also uses
the same User Agent, which we assume is likely stable over
short time intervals. (This approach still suffers from the possibil-
ity of multiple users behind a single IP address/NAT who employ
the same user agent [29].) We then examine a histogram of the do-
main names and search keywords11 in the HTTP requests generated
by the users. We observe:

• On average 60% of the users performed a search engine
query after encountering a block page for a porn domain,
and 75% of users did so after encountering a block page
for YouTube. Note that these proportions represent a lower

11We developed signatures to extract keywords from popular search
engine queries.

bound because we lack visibility into encrypted trafﬁc.12 We
ﬁnd that for porn, content-speciﬁc searches heavily dominate
these queries, rather than searches for porn domains, which
matches previous ﬁndings that porn users are ﬂexible about
served content as long as it falls into a broad class [42]. For
YouTube, we ﬁnd a diverse range of primarily informational
queries.13.

• For porn, on average 70% of users who hit a block page ac-
cess another porn domain within the next 5 minutes. For
YouTube, on the day of the block 7% of users viewed a video
using an alternate video content, rising to 12% in 02Aug13.
These ﬁgures run slightly lower than those from our sur-
vey, where 17% of respondents indicated that they would
use an alternate provider to access YouTube videos that they
ﬁnd blocked. Tying this in with our earlier result for search
queries being dominated by information-retrieval intent, we
speculate that users primarily settle for non-video represen-
tations of information, rather than actively searching for al-
ternate/unblocked providers to serve a video.

• Surprisingly, we do not ﬁnd a wide interest in either search-
ing for circumvention mechanisms or directly accessing non-
SSL web proxies within our analysis time window. For porn,
this is perhaps because users have a tendency to shift to other
unblocked porn providers, resulting in little incentive to try
circumvention.

IMPACT ON CONTENT PROVIDERS

Upon the imposition of censorship, users have a range of op-
tions: (i) stop accessing the censored content altogether, (ii) access
the same or similar content hosted by an alternate content provider,
or (iii) employ a censorship-bypass mechanism to directly access
the censored content. The ﬁrst two options lead to the censored

Table 11: Distribution of porn bandwidth among blocked and un-
blocked domains. In 21Dec11 and 28Feb12 the censor only uses
DNS for blocking, hence users can still access blocked content by
using an alternative name server. In 18Sep12, although the censor
uses IP blocking in addition to DNS blocking, its blocking is partial
for some domains. In 02Aug13, the censor uses a combination of
DNS blocking and HTTP redirection.

content provider losing a fraction of its previous trafﬁc, the sec-
ond of these may have a positive impact on the trafﬁc for alternate
content providers. The last option potentially increases costs for
content providers from the perspective of content distribution: they
will have to serve the blocked content remotely, due to the inabil-
ity to deploy local servers in the censored region. Additionally,
if the chosen circumvention mechanism anonymizes user location,
the censored content provider can no longer serve geographically-
relevant advertisements, which may reduce revenue. While our cur-
rent study does not concretely establish the economic implications
of censorship on content providers, we highlight where these may
manifest with a view to motivate further research.
7.1 Video Content

Table 8(a) illustrates the distribution of video bandwidth among
the four major providers before and after the YouTube block. An
overwhelming portion (an average of ≈ 97% across four pre-block
traces) of video content was provided by YouTube, up until the cen-
sorship event concurrent with 18Sep12. On that day, only ≈ 15%
of video content was fetched from YouTube, half of which was be-
ing served by local ISP cache servers, and the other half fetched
from servers located outside Pakistan. Recall that on that day, one
of the two national service providers (with direct international con-
nectivity) redirected YouTube HTTP trafﬁc to one of its own error
pages (Section 4). The residual percentage of YouTube trafﬁc per-
haps reﬂects the providers lacking sufﬁcient capacity to handle the
full load, and thus it failed to consistently redirect trafﬁc.

The following two ﬁndings support this hypothesis. First, the er-
ror page initially appeared only ﬁve minutes into the trace, suggest-
ing that the censorship was already taking place at the time trafﬁc
was captured. Second, we did not ﬁnd evidence of any incomplete
coverage in blocking YouTube’s IP address space: we ﬁnd sets of
IP addresses for which both videos were fetched successfully as
well as users were redirected to the error pages (for different HTTP
requests). The trace collected 11 months later does not manifest
any content served from YouTube. This does not necessarily im-
ply that users stopped accessing the site. Indeed, the percentage
of encrypted trafﬁc increased manyfold (see SOHO trafﬁc in Ta-
ble 7), from about 6% in Feb 2012 to over 30% of total trafﬁc post-
YouTube censorship, potentially indicating the use of SSL-based
censorship bypass mechanisms, as we discussed in Section 6.

Table 8(b) also indicates that post-censorship, most of the video
trafﬁc generated from within Pakistan initially switched to Daily-
Motion (82% of total trafﬁc in 18Sep12), but 11 months later split
between DailyMotion (40.9%) and Tune.pk (57.6%). This trafﬁc

280distribution is unusual considering the global trafﬁc statistics of
DailyMotion (≈ 23x more compared to Tune.pk [2]), thus indi-
cating strong regional popularity. Tune.pk is a Pakistani video por-
tal that essentially provides a censorship-friendly wrapper around
YouTube.
It downloads inoffensive YouTube videos and serves
them from its servers with an option for users to report offensive
videos [41]. The case of Tune.pk highlights the beneﬁts reaped by
local markets due to blocking of a competitor.

The overall shift in trafﬁc potentially leads to a redistribution
of advertisement revenue; the censored content provider loses out
in favor of alternate providers, a shift exacerbated by the fact that
local content owners tend to provide their content through video
sharing sites that remain accessible to their viewers without the
use of any circumvention technology. We ﬁnd such a trend in Ta-
ble 8(c), which shows more and more embedded links shifting from
YouTube to other video sharing sites. Most local content is now
served through embedded links of unblocked video providers: em-
bedded links pointing to YouTube drop from an average of around
83% to 73% the day of block (18Sep12), to about 51% 11 months
later (02Aug13), with DailyMotion getting ≈ 32% of embedded
links and Tune.pk jumping from virtually no embedding to nearly
11%.

The drop in the percentage of embedded YouTube links also
leads to search engines adjusting their page ranks for localized
searches. For example, a manual search (country-speciﬁc via
google.com.pk) for top-5 local television shows reveals that
the top results point to Tune.pk and DailyMotion, while a search
for non-local content (top-5 television shows in USA) returns top
results referencing YouTube.

In summary, the censored video content provider loses trafﬁc and
revenue to competing non-censored sites in multiple ways: direct
reduction of trafﬁc, local content providers moving their hosted
channels to alternate providers, reduced embedded referencing in
third-party pages, and lower page rank for localized search. The
provider potentially also loses revenue due to the increased expense
of serving the content via the distribution channels available to cir-
cumventers. For non-censored providers, these considerations may
provide an incentive to take long-term control over local content.
For example, DailyMotion has recently moved to partner with the
largest ISP in the country [15].

7.2 Porn Content

For each trace, we ranked the porn sites in accordance with their
trafﬁc served into the country, measured using the methodology
described in Section 5. Table 10 shows the top-5 coded porn do-
mains for each trace. We observe that prior to blocking, globally
popular domains [2] top the list. After the blocking event, new
players emerge and take the top spots. In most cases, these new
players were non-existent in previous traces (indicated with bold
in the table), and their relative distribution across post-block traces
vary inconsistently. (We do see a few domains, such as X, S and
R, that appear in the top-5 for more than one trace.) We speculate
that users are familiar with a few favorite porn websites, but, after
blocking, ﬁnd out about alternatives through search engines, hence
the variety in the top ranked sites. This possibility ﬁts with the ﬁnd-
ing in Section 6 that after landing on a block page, porn users tend
to perform content-speciﬁc search queries.

Similar to the non-porn video sharing sites, censoring a porn site
also impairs its revenue share from within the censored region. In
Table 11 we analyze the bandwidth distribution among blocked and
unblocked porn websites. We observe that the bulk of the band-
width is captured by unblocked porn domains. (An exception to
the case is ¯A, which appears in a subsequent trace despite being

blocked in 21Dec11—circumvention is made possible by obtain-
ing correct IP addresses via non-local resolvers.) The popularity of
new porn domains can also be explained by the fact that after the
initial introduction of the porn blacklist (21Dec11), there seems to
be no aggressive strategy by the censor to block new popular porn
content.

8.

IMPACT ON SERVICE PROVIDERS

In this section we assess the consequences of the censorship
events on ISPs. We examine this in terms of analyzing the oper-
ator’s web caching behavior, focusing on the video content from
the four major providers, since our pre-block traces indicate that
videos constitute the content (≈ 95%) served by the ISP’s cache
servers.14

Table 12 lists the top-5 ASNs serving video content for each of
the traces.15 Prior to the YouTube blocking, the top ASN is the lo-
cal ISP—on average its caching servers provided 76% of the video
content. On the day of blocking, we still see the ISP’s caching
servers providing a small fraction of YouTube video content. This
leakage indicates that, initially, the ISP’s censorship implementa-
tion was incomplete; its caching servers had not completely ﬂushed
cached YouTube content, and hence still served it upon request.
(Recall that the block was put in place on the day of capture; some
users could potentially get correct answers for YouTube from their
local DNS cache, or by using alternate DNS resolvers as previously
discussed.)

Moving forward 11 months, the local ISP completely falls off the
charts to be replaced by CDNs serving DailyMotion and Tune.pk
videos.
Indeed, we ﬁnd the ISP’s cache servers completely ab-
sent from 02Aug13, and the ISP conﬁrmed to us that the systems
no longer provided any utility. Based on discussions with the ISP
operators, we learned two reasons for this. First, Google had pro-
vided free caching servers to Pakistani ISPs, infrastructure tailored
speciﬁcally to YouTube-caching. The other video content providers
do not offer such free caching solutions, leaving it difﬁcult for the
local ISPs to justify the cost of deploying and maintaining custom
solutions for the providers’ content. Second, the drastic decrease
in unencrypted video content (Table 7) made it hard to justify the
beneﬁts of caching, since ISPs cannot in general cache encrypted
content. The ISPs instead turned to the option of leasing more
upstream bandwidth, rather than buying and maintaining caching
servers.

Consequently, today all video content is primarily fetched from
the servers of their respective providers. Indeed, the operators we
acquired traces from had to purchase additional Internet bandwidth
after the block.

9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have studied the impact of Internet censorship on major
stakeholders (service providers, content providers, and end users)
in the context of two major censorship events in Pakistan, the block
of porn content in 2011, and of YouTube in 2012. To this end,
we analyzed home and SOHO trafﬁc before, during, and after the
censorship events, from the vantage point of a mid-size ISP in a
large metropolitan area. As the foundation of our analysis, we de-

14We establish this by looking at the distribution of Content
Type served by the ISP’s caching servers.
15Labovitz noted that content delivery shifted to European servers
after MegaUpload servers in North America were seized [28]. Our
study focuses on alternate content providers when the primary has
been blocked, and the implications of their infrastructural arrange-
ments on an operator.

veloped methodologies to identify censorship activity within our
packet traces with high conﬁdence.

We observed that blocking of porn content caused increases in
encrypted trafﬁc (Table 7) but primarily users turned to alternative
sites (Table 10). In contrast, YouTube blocking caused a major shift
towards increased encrypted trafﬁc, indicating that users resorted
to circumvention mechanisms to continue their access. In addition,
we ﬁnd this shift well underway already on the day that the gov-
ernment imposed censorship, indicating that a portion of users can
very rapidly adapt to the introduction of new blocking mechanisms.
Censorship of YouTube also affected the ﬁnancial landscape
of video content providers (Table 8). New players emerged
and completely took over the video-sharing market that previ-
ously was almost wholly owned by YouTube prior to its blocking.
This shift also had consequences for ISPs that previously served
video content primarily from YouTube caches (freely provided by
Google) hosted within their own networks. Post-YouTube block-
ing, the ISPs must fetch video content through their upstream tran-
sit provider, reﬂecting an increase in bandwidth costs. After the
YouTube blocking was implemented at the local-ISP level (using
DNS spooﬁng), we observe a shift away from the use of the local
ISP’s DNS resolvers, dropping from more than 90% pre-blocking
to about 70% post-blocking. We note that such a shift somewhat
erodes a nation’s overall control over its Internet trafﬁc as users
transfer their base of trust (i.e., DNS resolution) to parties outside
the country.

Following up on this work, we plan to analyze additional data
from a different ISP in another large city in Pakistan to assess trends
seen across cities and providers. The expectation in Pakistan is that
porn blocking will continue in the future, but YouTube censorship
will soon end [16]. If that indeed happens, it will be illuminating
to study whether the proportion of encrypted trafﬁc returns to pre-
censorship levels; whether users continue to outsource their DNS
resolution; and the degree to which video trafﬁc distribution be-
tween YouTube and alternate video sharing sites readjusts.
