Abstract
February 2011 saw the emergence of Silk Road, the ﬁrst
successful online anonymous marketplace, in which buy-
ers and sellers could transact with anonymity properties
far superior to those available in alternative online or of-
ﬂine means of commerce. Business on Silk Road, pri-
marily involving narcotics trafﬁcking, rapidly boomed,
and competitors emerged. At the same time, law enforce-
ment did not sit idle, and eventually managed to shut
down Silk Road in October 2013 and arrest its operator.
Far from causing the demise of this novel form of com-
merce, the Silk Road take-down spawned an entire, dy-
namic, online anonymous marketplace ecosystem, which
has continued to evolve to this day. This paper presents a
long-term measurement analysis of a large portion of this
online anonymous marketplace ecosystem, including 16
different marketplaces, over more than two years (2013–
2015). By using long-term measurements, and combin-
ing our own data collection with publicly available pre-
vious efforts, we offer a detailed understanding of the
growth of the online anonymous marketplace ecosystem.
We are able to document the evolution of the types of
goods being sold, and assess the effect (or lack thereof)
of adversarial events, such as law enforcement operations
or large-scale frauds, on the overall size of the economy.
We also provide insights into how vendors are diversi-
fying and replicating across marketplaces, and how ven-
dor security practices (e.g., PGP adoption) are evolving.
These different aspects help us understand how tradi-
tional, physical-world criminal activities are developing
an online presence, in the same manner traditional com-
merce diversiﬁed online in the 1990s.

Introduction

In February 2011, a new Tor hidden service [16], called
“Silk Road,” opened its doors. Silk Road portrayed it-
self as an online anonymous marketplace, where buyers

and sellers could meet and conduct electronic commerce
transactions in a manner similar to the Amazon Market-
place, or the ﬁxed price listings of eBay. The key inno-
vation in Silk Road was to guarantee stronger anonymity
properties to its participants than any other online mar-
ketplace. The anonymity properties were achieved by
combining the network anonymity properties of Tor hid-
den services—which make the IP addresses of both the
client and the server unknown to each other and to out-
side observers—with the use of the pseudonymous, de-
centralized Bitcoin electronic payment system [33]. Silk
Road itself did not sell any product, but provided a feed-
back system to rate vendors and buyers, as well as escrow
services (to ensure that transactions were completed to
everybody’s satisfaction) and optional hedging services
(to buffer ﬂuctuations in the value of the bitcoin).

Embolden by the anonymity properties Silk Road pro-
vided, sellers and buyers on Silk Road mostly traded
in contraband and narcotics. While Silk Road was not
the ﬁrst venue to allow people to purchase such goods
online—older forums such at the Open Vendor Database,
or smaller web stores such as the Farmer’s Market pre-
dated it—it was by far the most successful one to date at
the time due to its (perceived) superior anonymity guar-
antees [13]. The Silk Road operator famously declared
in August 2013 in an interview with Forbes, that the
“War on Drugs” had been won by Silk Road and its pa-
trons [18]. While this was an overstatement, the business
model of Silk Road had proven viable enough that com-
petitors, such as Black Market Reloaded, Atlantis, or the
Sheep Marketplace had emerged.

Then,

in early October 2013, Silk Road was shut
down, its operator arrested, and all the money held in es-
crow on the site conﬁscated by law enforcement. Within
the next couple of weeks, reports of Silk Road sellers and
buyers moving to Silk Road’s ex-competitors (chieﬂy,
Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded) or start-
ing their own anonymous marketplaces started to sur-
face. By early November 2013, a novel incarnation

of Silk Road, dubbed “Silk Road 2.0” was online—set
up by former administrators and vendors of the origi-
nal Silk Road.1 Within a few months, numerous mar-
ketplaces following the same model of offering an on-
line anonymous rendez-vous point for sellers and buy-
ers appeared. These different marketplaces offered var-
ious levels of sophistication, durability and specializa-
tion (drugs, weapons, counterfeits, ﬁnancial accounts,
...). At the same time, marketplaces would often disap-
pear, sometimes due to arrests (e.g., as was the case with
Utopia [19]), sometimes voluntarily (e.g., Sheep Market-
place [34]). In other words, the anonymous online mar-
ketplace ecosystem had evolved signiﬁcantly compared
to the early days when Silk Road was nearly a monopoly.
In this paper, we present our measurements and anal-
ysis of the anonymous marketplace ecosystem over a pe-
riod of two and a half years between 2013 and 2015.
Previous studies either focused on a speciﬁc marketplace
(e.g., Silk Road [13]), or on simply describing high-level
characteristics of certain marketplaces, such as the num-
ber of posted listings at a given point in time [15].

By using long-term measurements, combining our
own data collection with publicly available previous ef-
forts, and validating the completeness of our dataset us-
ing capture and recapture estimation, we offer a much
more detailed understanding of the evolution of the on-
line anonymous marketplace ecosystem.
In particular,
we are able to measure the effect of the Silk Road take-
down on the overall sales volume; how reported “scams”
in some marketplaces dented consumer conﬁdence; how
vendors are diversifying and replicating across market-
places; and how security practices (e.g., PGP adoption)
are evolving. These different aspects paint what we be-
lieve is an accurate picture of how traditional, physical-
world criminal activities are developing an online pres-
ence, in the same manner traditional commerce diversi-
ﬁed online in the 1990s.

We discover several interesting properties. Our analy-
sis of the sales volumes demonstrates that as a whole the
online anonymous marketplace ecosystem appears to be
resilient, on the long term, to adverse events such as law
enforcement take-downs or “exit scams” in which the op-
erators abscond with the money. We also evidence stabil-
ity over time in the types of products being sold and pur-
chased: cannabis-, ecstasy- and cocaine-related products
consistently account for about 70% of all sales. Analyz-
ing vendor characteristics shows a mix of highly special-
ized vendors, who focus on a single product, and sellers
who sell a large number of different products. We also
discover that vendor population has long-tail characteris-
tics: while a few vendors are (or were) highly successful,
the vast majority of vendors grossed less than $10,000

over our entire study interval. This further substantiates
the notion that online anonymous marketplaces are pri-
marily competing with street dealers, in the retail space,
rather than with established criminal organizations which
focus on bulk sales.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides a brief overview of how the various on-
line marketplaces we study operate. Section 3 describes
our measurement methodology and infrastructure. Sec-
tion 4 presents our measurement analysis. We discuss
limitations of our approach and resulting open questions
in Section 5, before introducing the related work in Sec-
tion 6 and ﬁnally concluding in Section 7.

2 Online Anonymous Marketplaces

The sale of contraband and illicit products on the Internet
can probably be traced back to the origins of the Internet
itself, with a number of forums and bulletin board sys-
tems where buyers and sellers could interact.

However, online markets have met with consider-
able developments in sophistication and scale, over the
past six years or so, going from relatively conﬁdential
“classiﬁeds”-type of listings such as on the Open Vendor
Database, to large online anonymous marketplaces. Fol-
lowing the Silk Road blueprint, modern online anony-
mous markets run as Tor hidden services, which gives
participants (marketplace operators and participants such
as buyers and sellers) communication anonymity proper-
ties far superior to those available from alternative solu-
tions (e.g., anonymous hosting); and use pseudonymous
online currencies as payment systems (e.g., Bitcoin [33])
to make it possible to exchange money electronically
without the immediate traceability that conventional pay-
ment systems (wire transfers, or credit card payments)
provide.

The common point between all these marketplaces is
that they actually are not themselves selling contraband.
Instead, they are risk management platforms for partici-
pants in (mostly illegal) transactions. Risk is mitigated
on several levels. First, by abolishing physical inter-
actions between transacting parties, these marketplaces
claim to reduce (or indeed, eliminate) the potential for
physical violence during the transaction.

Second, by providing superior anonymity guarantees
compared to the alternatives, online anonymous market-
places shield – to some degree2 – transaction participants
from law enforcement intervention.

Third, online anonymous marketplaces provide an es-
crow system to prevent ﬁnancial risk. These systems are
very similar in spirit to those developed by electronic

2Physical items still need to be delivered, which is a potential inter-
vention point for law enforcement as shown in documented arrests [4].

were crawled, the time the measurements spanned, and the number of
snapshots that were taken. ∗ denote market sites seized by the police,
† voluntary shutdowns, and ‡ (suspected) fraudulent closures (owners
absconding with escrow money).

Second, we want the scrapes to be complete, instanta-
neous, and frequent. Scrapes that are instantaneous and
complete convey a coherent picture about what is taking
place on the marketplace without doubts about possible
unobserved actions or the inconsistency that may be in-
troduced by time delay. Scraping very often ensures that
we have high precision in dating when actions occurred,
and reduces the chances of missing vendor actions, such
as listing and rapidly de-listing a given item.

Third we want our scraper to be reliable even when the
marketplace that we are measuring is not. Even when a
marketplace is unavailable for hours, the scraper should
hold state and retry to avoid an incomplete capture.

Fourth,

the scraper should be capable of handling
client-side state normally kept by the users browser such
as cookies, and be robust enough to avoid any detection
schemes that might be devised to thwart the scraper. We
attempt to address these design objectives as follows.

Avoiding censorship Before we add a site to the scrap-
ing regimen, we ﬁrst manually inspect it and identify
its layout. We build and use as input to the scraper a
conﬁguration including regular expressions on the URLs
for that particular marketplace. This allows us to avoid
following links that may cause undesirable actions to be
performed such as adding items to a cart, sending mes-
sages or logging out. We also provide as input to the
scraper a session cookie that we obtain by manually log-
ging into the marketplace and solving a CAPTCHA; and
parameters such as the maximum desired scraping rate.
In addition to being careful about what to request from
a marketplace, we obfuscate how we request content. For
each page request, the scraper randomly selects a Tor cir-
cuit out of 20 pre-built circuits. This strategy ensures that
the requests are being distributed over several rendez-
vous points in the Tor network. This helps prevent trig-
gering anti-DDoS heuristics certain marketplaces use.5
This strategy also provides redundancy in the event that
one of the circuits being used becomes unreliable and
speeds up the time it takes to observe the entire site.
Completeness,
soundness, and instantaneousness
The goal of the data collection is to make an observa-
tion of the entire marketplace at an instantaneous point
in time, which yields information such as item listings,
pricing information, feedback, and user pages. Instan-
taneous observations are of course impossible, and can
only be approximated by scraping the marketplace as
quickly as possible. Scraping a site aggressively however
limits the stealth of the scraper; We manually identiﬁed
sites that prohibit aggressive scraping (e.g., Agora) and
imposed appropriate rate limits.

Scrape completeness is also crucial. A partial scrape
of a site may lead to underestimating the activities taking
place. Fortunately, since marketplaces leverage feedback
to build vendor reputation, old feedback is rarely deleted.
This means that it is sufﬁcient for an item listing and its
feedback to be eventually observed in order to know that
the transaction took place. Over time, the price of an
item may ﬂuctuate however, and information about when
the transaction occurred often becomes less precise, so it
is much more desirable to observe feedback as soon as
possible after it is left. We generally attempted a scrape
for each marketplace once every two to three days unless
the marketplace was either unavailable or the previous
scrape had not yet completed; having collected most of
the data we were interested in by that time, we scraped
considerably less often toward the end of our data collec-
tion interval (February through May 2015).

Many marketplaces that we observed have quite poor
reliability, with 70% uptime or lower. It is very difﬁcult
5However some marketplaces, e.g., Agora, use session cookies to
bind requests coming from different circuits, and require additional at-
tention.

to extract entire scrapes from marketplaces suffering fre-
quent outages. This is particularly true for large sites,
where a complete scrape can take several days. As a
workaround, we designed the scraping infrastructure to
keep state and retry pages using an increasing back-off
interval for up to 24 hours. Using such a system allowed
the scraper to function despite brief outages in market-
place availability. Retrying the site after 24 hours would
be futile as in most cases, the session cookie would have
expired and the scrape would require a manual login, and
thus a manual restart.

Most marketplaces require the user to log in before
they are able to view item listings and other sensitive
information. Fortunately, creating an account on these
marketplaces is free. However, one typically needs to
solve a CAPTCHA when logging in; this was done man-
ually. The process of performing a scrape begins with
manually logging into the marketplace, extracting the
session cookie, and using it as input to the scrape to
continue scraping under that session. In many cases the
site will fail to respond to requests properly unless mul-
tiple cookies are managed or unless the user agent of
the scraper matches the user agent of the browser that
generated the cookie. We managed to emulate typical
browser behavior in all but one case (BlueSky). We were
unable to collect meaningful data on BlueSky, as an anti-
scraping measure on the server side was to annihilate any
session after approximately 100 page requests, and get
the user to log in again.

3.2 Parsing marketplaces
The raw page data collected by the scraper needs to be
parsed to extract information useful for analysis. The
parser ﬁrst identiﬁes which marketplace a particular page
was scraped from; it then determines which type of page
is being analyzed (item listing, user page, feedback page,
or any combination of those).

Each page is then parsed using a set of heuristics we
manually devised for each marketplace. We treat the in-
formation extracted as a single observation and record it
into a database. Information that does not exist or cannot
be parsed is assigned default values.

The heuristics for parsing can often become quite
complicated as many marketplaces observed over long
periods of time went through several iterations of page
formats. This justiﬁed our conscious decision to decou-
ple scraping from parsing so that we could minimize
data loss. Because of the high manual effort associ-
ated with creating and debugging new parsers for market-
places, we only generated parsers for marketplaces that
we perceived to be of signiﬁcance. While observing the
scrapes of several marketplaces, it became apparent that
their volume was either extremely small (<$1,000) or

was not measurable by observing the website (e.g., be-
cause feedback is not mandatory). These marketplaces
were omitted without greatly affecting the overall pic-
ture; their analysis is left for future work.

Internally validating data analysis

3.3
To ensure that the analysis we performed was not biased,
and as a safety against egregious errors, both authors
of this paper concurrently and independently developed
multiple implementations of the analysis we present in
the next section. During that stage of the work, the two
authors relied on the same data sources, but used different
analysis code and tools and did not communicate with
each other until all results were produced.

We then internally conﬁrmed that the independent esti-
mations of total market volumes varied by less than 10%
at any single point in time, and less than 5% on aver-
age, well within expected margin of errors for data in-
directly estimated from potentially noisy sources (user
feedback).6 The independent reproducibility of the anal-
ysis is important since, as we will show, estimating mar-
ket volumes presents many pitfalls, such as the risk of
double-counting observations or using a holding price as
the true value of an item.

3.4 Validating data completeness
The poor availability of certain marketplaces (e.g.,
Agora), combined with the large amount of time needed
to fully scrape very large marketplaces raises concerns
about data completeness. We attempt to estimate the
amount of data that might be missing through a process
known as marking and recapturing.

The basic idea is as follows. Consider that a given site
scrape at time t contains a number M of feedback. Since
we do not know whether the scrape is complete, we can
only assert that M is a lower bound on the total num-
ber of feedback F actually present on the site at time t.
Now, consider a second scrape (presumably taken after
time t), which contains n pieces of feedback left at or be-
fore time t. The number n is another lower bound of F.
We then estimate F as ˆF = nM/m, where m is the num-
ber of feedback captured in the ﬁrst scrape that we also
observe in the second scrape (m ≤ M).
The Schnabel estimator [36] extends the above tech-
nique to estimate the size of a population to multiple
samples, and is thus well-suited to our measurements.
For n samples, if we denote by Ct the number of feed-
back in sample t, by Mt the total number of unique previ-
ously observed feedback in sample (t − 1), and by Rt the
6These minor discrepancies can be attributed to slightly different

ﬁltering heuristics, which we discuss later.

4 Analysis

The Schnabel estimator implicitly assumes that the
distribution is time-invariant and that samples are drawn
uniformly. To help ensure time invariance, the estima-
tor begins with a sample at time t. Pieces of feedback
with timestamps greater than t are omitted from all sam-
ples taken in the future (t + τ). It is also important not to
consider samples from too far into the future since items
are occasionally de-listed and the corresponding feed-
back destroyed. To help minimize the impact of feed-
back deleted in the future, we only use samples within
60 days of t in our estimate.

We illustrate this estimate in Figure 2 for Agora, Silk
Road 1, Silk Road 2, and Evolution after multiple obser-
vations have been made. Agora has relatively poor relia-
bility and, on average, a single scrape will not manage to
capture even half of the feedback present at that time on
the site. On other marketplaces it is typical on the ﬁrst
visit to see as much as 60% of the entire population, or
higher. After ten or more independent scrapes, we can
expect to obtain a dataset that approaches 90% coverage
or higher.

Figure 3 further illustrates our point, by comparing the
number of pieces of feedback observed on Agora to its
estimate. For most of the observed lifetime of Agora,
the data that we have is very close to what we estimate
the total to be. This is because information about a mar-
ketplace at a particular (past) point in time beneﬁts from
subsequent observations. Most recent observations do
not have this beneﬁt and therefore suffer from poor cov-
erage, leading to signiﬁcant divergence from their esti-
mate. This results in potentially large underestimations

We next turn to data analysis. We ﬁrst estimate the over-
all evolution of the sales volumes in the entire ecosystem
over the past couple of years. We then move to an assess-
ment of the types of products being sold over time. Last,
we discuss ﬁndings about vendor activity and techniques.

4.1 Sales volumes
The ﬁrst important question that our analysis answers is
how much product in terms of money is being bought and
sold on online anonymous marketplaces. While we can-
not directly measure the money being transacted from
buyers to sellers, or packages being shipped from ven-
dors to customers, we do make frequent observations of
product feedback left for particular item listings on the
marketplaces. Similar to prior work [13], we use these
observations of feedback as a proxy to estimate a lower
bound for sales.

Caveats
In many marketplaces (e.g., Silk Road, Silk
Road 2.0, Agora, Evolution among others) customers are
required to leave feedback for a vendor whenever they re-
ceive their order of one of the vendor’s items. An order
for an item may be of varying quantity, so a customer
that purchases a single quantity of a product, and a cus-
tomer that purchases multiple quantities of a product will
both leave a single feedback. In an effort to be conser-
vative, we make the assumption that for every feedback
observed, only a single quantity was purchased.

Our prudent strategy of estimating sales volume from
conﬁrmed observations of feedback diverges from other,

simpler approaches, such as counting the number of item
listings offered (see, e.g., [15]). For instance, over the
observed lifetime of Evolution, a few of the most suc-
cessful item listings had feedback entries that indicated
over 1 million dollars had been spent on each of them.
The presence of these highly inﬂuential item listings sug-
gests that simply counting the total number of listings on
a site is a very poor indicator of sales volume. This claim
is compounded by the observation that the average sales
per item listing per day on Evolution in early July of 2014
was $85.14; but by September 2014, after new vendors
and item listings had entered, the sales per item listing
had declined to $19.42. Such volatile behavior is par-
ticularly common in marketplaces that are small or are
going through periods of rapid growth.
Estimation We derived the estimates for the total
amount of money transacted in three steps. We ﬁrst
took the set of all feedback observations that had been
collected and removed any duplicates. For example, on
two consecutive scrapes of a particular marketplace, the
same item listing and its entire feedback history were
observed and recorded twice.
It would be incorrect to
count two different observations of the same feedback
twice. We thus developed a criterion for uniqueness
for each marketplace—typically enforcing uniqueness of
ﬁelds such as feedback message body, the vendor for
which the feedback was left, the title of the item list-
ing and the approximate date the feedback was left. Two
pieces of feedback are considered different if and only if
they differ in at least one of these categories.

The second step was to identify the the point in time at
which the feedback was left. This time is an upper bound
on when the transaction occurred. We obtained this esti-
mate by noting the time of the observation and utilizing
any information available about the age of the feedback.
Different marketplaces have varying precision informa-
tion about feedback timestamps. In the most precise in-
stances, the time that the feedback was left is speciﬁed
within the hour; in the most ambiguous cases, we can
only infer the month in which feedback was deposited.
Fortunately, due to our rather high sampling rate of the
marketplaces, in most instances we have roughly a 24-
hour accuracy on feedback time.

The third and ﬁnal step is to identify the value of the
transaction that each feedback represents. This involves
pairing each feedback observation with a single obser-
vation of an item listing and its advertised price. Care-
ful attention must be paid here as a few caveats exist,
namely that the advertised price of an item listing varies
with time, and that, in some rare cases, the correspond-
ing item is never observed, leaving us unable to identify
the value of the transaction.

Item prices change for two different reasons. The ﬁrst
and most common reason is that the vendors responsi-

ble for selling items are subject to standard free market
pressures and may raise or lower their prices in response
to competition, supply, demand, or other factors. The
second reason is that when a vendor temporarily wishes
to halt sales of an item with the expectation of selling it
again in the future, instead of de-listing the item and los-
ing all of the reviews and ratings that have accumulated
over time, the vendor instead raises the price to some-
thing prohibitively high in order to discourage any sales.
This is what we call a holding price. Holding prices are
particularly dangerous for our analysis, because they can
be in excess of millions of dollars. So, mistaking a hold-
ing price for an actual price just once could have dramatic
consequences on the overall analysis.

Dealing with holding prices Given a particular feed-
back and a set of observations of the corresponding prod-
uct listing, the objective becomes to determine which
observation yields the most accurate price for that feed-
back. Independent analysis (see Section 3.3) yielded two
different heuristics for solving this problem. In the ﬁrst
heuristic (Heuristic A), we dismissed observations of the
listing where the price was greater than $10,000 USD as
well as observations that showed prices of zero (free).
We then dismissed observations that were greater than 5
times the median of the remaining samples as well as ob-
servations that were less than 25% the value of the me-
dian. We manually observed thousands of product list-
ings and identiﬁed that only in some very rare cases were
the assumptions violated.

The second heuristic (Heuristic B) proceeded by re-
moving observations with a price >$10,000 USD, as
well as the upper quartile and any observations that were
more than 100 times greater than the observation cor-
responding to the cheapest, non-zero price. To under-
stand the effect that these heuristics had on observa-
tions, we calculated the coefﬁcient of variation deﬁned
as cv = σ /µ (standard deviation over mean) for the set

of observations for each item listing and plotted its cu-
mulative distribution function.

Figure 4 shows that without any ﬁltering, about 5% of
all item listings were at some point sampled with highly
variable prices, which suggests that a holding price was
observed for this listing. Both heuristics produce rela-
tively similar ﬁltering; we ended up using Heuristic A in
the rest of the analysis.

After applying the ﬁlter, there is still some smaller
variation in the pricing of many listings which is consis-
tent with the ﬂuctuation in prices due to typical market
pressures but it is clear that no listings with extremely
high variations remain. 79,512 total unique item listings
were identiﬁed, 1,003 (1.26%) of which had no valid
observations remaining after ﬁltering, meaning that the
output of the heuristic was the empty set, the remaining
78,509 item listings returned at least one acceptable ob-
servation.

After ﬁltering the listing observations, we pair each
feedback with one of the remaining listing samples. To
minimize the difference in estimated price of the feed-
back from the true price, we select the listing observation
that is closest to the feedback in time. At this point we
have a set of unique pieces of feedback, each mapped to a
price at some point in time; from there, we can construct
an estimate for the sales volumes.

Results We present our results in Figure 5 where we
show the total volume, per marketplace we study, over
time. The plot is stacked, which means that the top line

corresponds to the total volume cleared by all market-
places under study.
In early 2013, we only have re-
sults for Silk Road, which at that point grossed around
$300,000/day, far more than previously estimated for
2012 [13]. This number would project to over $100M
in a year; combined by the previous $15M estimate [13]
for early 2012, and “ﬁlling in” gaps for data we do not
have in late 2012, appears consistent with the (revised)
US Government calculations of $189M of total grossed
income by Silk Road over its lifetime, based on Bitcoin
transaction logs.

We then have a data collection gap, roughly corre-

do not show volumes for Atlantis, which are negligi-
ble, in the order of $2,000–3,000/day.) Shortly after the
Silk Road take-down we started measuring Black Market
Reloaded, and realized that it has already made up for a
vast portion of the volumes previously seen on Silk Road.
We do not have sales data for Sheep Marketplace due to
incomplete parses, but we do believe that the combina-
tion of both markets made up for the loss of Silk Road.
Then, both Sheep and Black Market Reloaded closed –
in the case of Sheep, apparently fraudulently. There was
then quite a bit of turmoil with various markets starting
and failing quickly. Only around late November 2013
did the ecosystem ﬁnd a bit more stability, as Silk Road
2.0 had been launched and was rapidly growing. In par-
allel Pandora, Agora, and Evolution were also launched.
By late January 2014, volumes far exceeded what was
seen prior to the Silk Road take-down. At that point,
though, a massive scam on Silk Road 2.0 caused dra-
matic loss of user conﬁdence, which is evidenced by the
rapid decrease until April 2014, before it starts recov-
ering. Competitors however were not affected. (Agora
does show spikes due to very imprecise feedback timing
at a couple of points.) Eventually, in the Fall of 2014,
the anonymous online marketplace ecosystem reached
unprecedented highs. We started collecting data from
Evolution in July, so it is possible that we miss quite a
bit in the early part of 2014, but the overall take-away is
unchanged. Finally, in November 2014, Operation Ony-
mous [38] resulted in the take-down of Silk Road 2 and a
number of less marketplaces. This did signiﬁcantly af-
fect total sales, but we immediately see a rebound by
people going to Evolution and Agora. We censor the
data we obtained from February 2015: at that point we
only have results for Agora and Evolution, but coverage
is poor, and as explained in Section 3, is likely to un-
derestimate volumes signiﬁcantly. We did note a short
volume decrease prior to the Evolution “exit scam” of
March 2015. We have not analyzed data for other smaller
marketplaces (e.g., Black Bank, Middle Earth, or Nu-
cleus) but suspect the volumes are much smaller. Fi-
nally, more recent marketplaces such as AlphaBay seem

to have grown rapidly after the Evolution exit scam, but
feedback on AlphaBay is not mandatory, and thus cannot
be used to reliably estimate sales volumes.

In short,

the entire ecosystem shows resilience to
scams – Sheep, but also Pandora, which, as we can see
started off very well before losing ground due to a loss in
customer conﬁdence, before shutting down. The effect
of law enforcement take-downs (Silk Road 1&2, Oper-
ation Onymous) is mixed at best:
the ecosystem rela-
tively quickly recovered from the Silk Road shutdown,
and appears to have withstood Operation Onymous quite
well, since aggregate volumes were back within weeks to
more than half what they were prior to Operation Ony-
mous. We however caution that one would need longer
term data to fully assess the impact of Operation Ony-
mous.

4.2 Product categories
In addition to estimating the value of the products that
are being sold, we strived to develop an understanding of
what is being sold. Several marketplaces such as Agora
and Evolution include information on item listing pages
that describe the nature of the listing as provided by the
vendor that posted it. Unfortunately these descriptions
are often too speciﬁc, conﬂict across marketplaces, and
in the case of some sites, are not even available at all.

For our analysis, we need a consistent and coherent
labeling for all items, so that we could categorize them
into broad mutually exclusive categories. We thus im-
plemented a machine learning classiﬁer that was trained
and tested on samples from Agora and Evolution, where
ground truth was available via labeling. We then took
this classiﬁer and applied it to item listings on all mar-
ketplaces to answer the question of what is being sold.

We took 1,941,538 unique samples from Evolution
and Agora, where a sample is the concatenation of an
item listing’s title and all descriptive information about it
that was parsed from the page. We tokenized each sam-
ple under the assumption that the sample is written in
English, resulting in a total of 162,198 unique words ob-
served. We then computed a tf-idf value for each of the
162,198 words in the support for each sample, and used
these values as inputs to an L2-Penalized SVM under L2-
Loss implemented using Python and scikit-learn.

We evaluated our classiﬁer using 10-fold cross val-
idation. The overall precision and recall were both
(roughly) 0.98. We also evaluated the classiﬁer on
Agora data when trained with samples from Evolution
and vice-versa to ensure that the classiﬁer was not bi-
ased to only perform well on the distributions it was
trained on. The confusion matrix in Figure 6 shows
that classiﬁcation performance is very strong for all cat-
egories. Only “Misc” is occasionally confused with Dig-

ital Goods and Prescriptions are occasionally confused
with Benzos (which in fact is not necessarily surprising).
We believe that these errors are most likely caused by
mislabeled test samples. Although we drew our samples
from Evolution and Agora which provide a speciﬁc label
for each listing, the label is selected by the vendor and
may be erroneous, particularly for listings that are hard
to place. Manual inspection revealed that several of the
errors came from item listings that offered US $100 Bills
in exchange for Bitcoin.

We then applied the classiﬁer to the aggregate analy-
sis performed earlier. In addition to placing a particu-
lar feedback in time, and pairing it with an item listing
observation to derive the price, we predicted the class
label of that listing and aggregated the price by class la-
bel. Figure 7 shows the normalized market aggregate by
category. Drug paraphernalia, weapons, electronics, to-
bacco, sildenaﬁl, and steroids were collapsed into a cat-
egory called ‘Other’ for clarity.

Over time the fraction of market share that belongs to
each category is relatively stable. However, around Oc-
tober of 2013, December 2013, March 2014, and January
2015, cannabis spikes up to as much as half of the market
share. These spikes correspond to the earlier mentioned

and 4) Operation Onymous respectively. These are all
events that generated substantial doubts in both vendors
and consumers regarding the safety and security of oper-
ating on these marketplaces. At these times the perceived
risk of operation was higher, which may have exerted
pressure towards buying and selling cannabis as opposed
to other products for which the punishment if caught is
much more severe. We can also see that digital goods
take an unusually high market share in times of uncer-
tainty, which is most obvious around October 2013: this
is not surprising as digital goods are often a good way to
quickly accumulate large numbers of listings on a new
marketplace.

Figure 7 shows that after an event such as a take-down
or large scale scam occurs, it takes about 2–3 months
before consumer and vendor conﬁdence is restored and
the markets converge back to equilibrium. At equilib-
rium, cannabis and MDMA (ecstasy) are about 25%
of market demand each with stimulants closely behind
at about 20%. Psychedelics, opioids, and prescription
drugs are a little less than 10% of market demand each,
although starting in November 2014, prescription drugs
have gained signiﬁcant traction—perhaps making anony-
mous marketplaces a viable alternative to unlicensed on-
line pharmacies.

4.3 Vendors
Online anonymous marketplaces are only successful
when they manage to attract a large enough vendor pop-
ulation to provide a critical mass of offerings. At the

and are thus counted multiple times here.

same time, vendors are not bound to a speciﬁc market-
place. Anecdotal evidence shows that certain sellers list
products on several marketplaces at once; likewise, cer-
tain sellers “move” from marketplace to marketplace in
response to law enforcement take-down or other market-
place failures. Here, we try to provide a good picture of
the vendor dynamics across the entire ecosystem.

Number of sellers Figure 8 shows, over time, the evo-
lution of the number of active sellers on all the market-
places we considered. For each marketplace, a seller
is deﬁned as active at time T is we observed her hav-
ing at least one active listing at time t ≤ T , and at least
one active listing (potentially the same) at a time t ≥ T .
This is a slightly different deﬁnition from that used in
Christin [13] which required an active listing at time t to
count a seller as active. For us, active sellers include sell-
ers that may be on vacation but will come back, whereas
Christin did not include such sellers. As a result, our re-
sults for Silk Road are very slightly higher than his.

The main takeaway from Figure 8 is that the number of
sellers overall has considerably increased since the days
of Silk Road. By the time Silk Road stopped activities in
2013, it featured around 1,400 sellers; its leading com-
petitors, Atlantis and Black Market Reloaded (BMR)
were much smaller. After the Silk Road take-down (Oc-
tober 2013) and Atlantis closure, we observe that both
BMR and the Sheep marketplace rapidly pick up a large
inﬂux of sellers. In parallel, Silk Road 2.0 also grows at

evolution of the number of aliases per seller across all marketplaces,
over time. The contour of the curve denotes the total number of sellers
overall.

a very rapid pace. Successful newcomers like Pandora,
Agora, and Evolution also see quick rises in the num-
ber of sellers. After a certain amount of time, however,
per-marketplace population tends to stabilize, even in the
most popular marketplaces. On the other hand, we also
observe that some marketplaces never took off: The Mar-
ketplace, Hydra, Deepbay, and Tor Bazaar, for instance,
consistently have a small number of vendors. In other
words, we see very strong network effects: Either mar-
ketplaces manage to get initial traction and then rapidly
ﬂourish, or they never manage to take off.
Sellers and aliases After Silk Road was taken down,
a number of sellers reportedly moved to Black Market
Reloaded or the Sheep Marketplace. More generally,
nothing prevents a vendor from opening shop on multiple
marketplaces; in fact, it is probably a desirable strategy
to hedge against marketplace take-downs or failures. As
a result, a given seller, Sally, may have multiple vendor
accounts on several marketplaces: Sally may sell on Silk
Road 2 as “Sally,” on Agora as “sally” and on Evolution
as “Easy Sally;” she may even have a second Evolution
account (“The Real Easy Sally”).

We formally deﬁne an alias as a unique (vendor nick-
name, marketplace) pair, and link different aliases to
the same vendor using the combination of the follow-
ing three heuristics. We ﬁrst consider vendor nicknames
on different marketplaces with only case differences as
belonging to the same person (e.g., “Sally” and “sally”).

We then use the InfoDesk feature of the Grams “DarkNet
Markets” search engine [2] to further link various ven-
dor nicknames.7 We ﬁlter out vendor nicknames consist-
ing only of a common substring (e.g., “weed,” “dealer,”
“Amsterdam,” ...) used by many vendors prior to con-
ducting the search. Finally, we link all vendor accounts
that claim to be using the same PGP key. Clearly, our
linking strategy is very conservative – in the sense that
minor variations like “Sally” and “Sally!” will not be
linked absent a common PGP key.

Using this set of heuristics, from a total of 29,258
unique aliases observed across our entire measurement
interval, we obtain a list of 9,386 sellers. In Figure 9, we
show, over time, the number of vendors that have one,
two or up to six aliases active at any given time T (where
we use the same deﬁnition of “active” as earlier, i.e., the
alias has at least one listing available before and after T ).
The plot is by deﬁnition incomplete since we can only
take into account, for each time t, the marketplaces that
we have crawled (and parsed) at time t.

For instance, the earlier part of the data show a com-
plete monopoly: this is not surprising since we only have
data for Silk Road at that time, even though Black Mar-
ket Reloaded was also active at the same time. We ob-
serve in the summer of 2013 that a few vendors sell si-
multaneously on Silk Road and Atlantis, but the prac-
tice of having multiple vendor accounts on several sites
seems to only really take hold in 2014, after many mar-
ketplaces failed in the Fall of 2013 (including Silk Road,
and many of its short-lived successors). The second jump
in July 2014 corresponds to our starting to collect data
for the very large Evolution marketplace. Finally, the
decrease observed in late 2014 is due to Operation Ony-
mous [38], which – besides Silk Road 2.0 – took down a
relatively large number of secondary marketplaces, such
as Cloud 9.

Besides the relatively robust rise is the number of sell-
ers to take-downs and scams, the main takeaway from
this plot is that the majority of sellers appear to only
use one alias – but this may be a bit misleading, as (as
we will see later) a large number of vendors sell ex-
tremely limited quantities of products. An interesting
extension would be to check whether “top” vendors di-
versify across marketplaces or not.

We complement this analysis by looking into the “sur-
vivability” functions of aliases and sellers, which we re-
port in Figure 10. Here the survival function is deﬁned
as the probability p(τ) that a given seller (resp. alias)
observed at time t be still active at time t + τ. The ﬁg-
ure shows the survival function, derived from a Kaplan-
Meier estimator [24] to account for the fact that we have
ﬁnite measurement intervals, along with 95% conﬁdence

suspect the vendor directory is primarily based on manual curation.

intervals. The key ﬁndings here are that half of the sell-
ers are only present for 220 days or less; half of the
aliases only exist for 172 days or less. More interest-
ing is the “long-tail” phenomenon we observe: a number
(more than 10%) of sellers have been active throughout
the entire measurement interval. More generally approx-
imately 25% of all sellers are “in it for the long run,”
and remain active (with various aliases on various mar-
ketplaces) for years.

Volumes per vendor
In an effort to obtain a more
clear understanding of how vendors operate, we aggre-
gated unique feedback left for products by vendor. We
used this to calculate the total value of the transactions
for items sold by each vendor and then grouped these
vendor aliases to yield the total value of transactions for
each seller. Figure 11 plots the CDF of sellers by the to-
tal value of their transactions. About 70% of all sellers
never managed to sell more than $1,000 worth of prod-
ucts. Another 18% of sellers were observed to sell be-

Figure 12: Vendor diversity

tween $1,000 and $10,000 but only about 2% of ven-
dors managed to sell more than $100,000.
In fact, 35
sellers were observed selling over $1,000,000 worth of
product and the top 1% most successful vendors were re-
sponsible for 51.5% of all the volume transacted. Some
of these sellers, like “SuperTrips” (or to a lesser extent,
“Nod”) from Silk Road, have been arrested, and numbers
released in connection with these arrests are consistent
with our ﬁndings [4, 6].

There is a clear discrepancy between sellers that ex-
periment in the marketplaces and those who manage to
leverage it to operate a successful business. Going for-
ward, we deﬁne any seller that we have observed selling
in excess of $10,000 to be successful. This allows us
to draw conclusions only about vendors that have had a
meaningful impact on the marketplace ecosystem. Now
that we know how much sellers are selling, we wish to
understand what they are selling. Once again we group
feedback by vendor but this time we also use the classi-
ﬁer to categorize the items that were being sold and ag-
gregate by category. Let C be the set of normalized item
categories for each seller and S be the set of all sellers
across all marketplaces. So, |C| = 16, and |S | = 9,386.
Deﬁne Ci(s j) as the normalized value of the i-th category
for seller j such that ∀s j ∈ S, ∑|C|
i=1 Ci(s j) = 1. Then,
we deﬁne the coefﬁcient of diversity for a seller s j as:
i (cid:30)Ci(s j)(cid:29)(cid:28) |C|

cd =(cid:31)1− max

Intuitively, the coefﬁcient of diversity is measuring
how invested a seller is into their most popular category,
normalized so that cd ∈ [0,1]. When evaluating the cate-
gories that different sellers are invested in, it only makes
sense to consider successful sellers as less signiﬁcant
sellers are volatile and greatly inﬂuenced by an individ-
ual sale in some category.

we argue that there are roughly three types of sellers. The
ﬁrst type of seller with a coefﬁcient of diversity between
0 and 0.1 is highly specialized, and sells exactly one type
of product. About half of all sellers are highly special-
ized and indicates that the seller has access to a steady
long-term supply of some type of product. About one
third of all vendors who specialize sell cannabis, another
third sell digital goods, and the last third sell in the var-
ious other categories. While digital goods is a relatively
small share of the total marketplace ecosystem, it tends
to attract vendors that specialize. This is likely due to
the domain expertise required for actions such as manu-
facturing fake IDs or stealing credit cards. The second
type of seller has a diversity coefﬁcient of between 0.1
and 0.5 and generally specializes in two or three types of
products. The most common two categories to simulta-
neously specialize in are ecstasy and psychedelics – i.e.,
primarily recreational and club drugs. The third type of
vendor has a diversity coefﬁcient greater than 0.5 and
has no specialty but rather sells a variety of items. These
types of sellers may be networks of users with access to
many different sources, or may be involved in arbitrage
between markets.
PGP deployment We conclude our discussion of ven-
dor behavior by looking in more detail at their security
practices. While we cannot easily assess their overall
operational security, we consider a very simple proxy for
security behavior:
the availability of a valid PGP key.
From our data set, we extracted 7,717 PGP keys. Most
vendors use keys of appropriate length, even though we
did observe a couple of oddities (e.g., a 2,047-bit key!)
that might indicate an incorrect use of the software. In-
spired by Heninger et al. [20] and Lenstra et al. [25] we
checked all pairs of keys to determine whether or not
they had common primes. We did not ﬁnd any, which
either suggests that GPG software was always properly
used and with a good random number generator, or, more
likely, that our dataset is too small to contain evidence of
weak keys.

We then plot in Figure 13 the fraction of vendors, over
time, that have (at least) one usable PGP key. We take
an extremely inclusive view of PGP deployment here: as
long as a vendor has advertised a valid PGP key for one
or her active aliases, we consider they are using PGP. As
vendors deal with highly sensitive information such as
postal delivery addresses of their customers, we would
expect close to 100% deployment. We see that, despite
improvements, this is not the case. In the original Silk
Road, only approximately 2/3 to 3/4 of vendors had a
valid PGP key listed. During the upheaval of the 2013
Fall, with many marketplaces opening and shutting down
quickly, we see that PGP deployment is very low. When
the situation stabilizes in January 2014, we observe an
increase in PGP adoption;
interestingly, after Opera-

tion Onymous, adoption seems even higher, which can
be construed as an evolutionary argument: marketplaces
that support and encourage PGP use by their sellers (such
as Evolution and Agora) might have been also more se-
cure in other respects, and more resilient against take-
downs. Shortly before the Evolution shutdown, PGP de-
ployment on Agora and Evolution was close to 90%.

5 Discussion

A study of this kind brings up a number of important
discussion points. We focus here on what we consider
are the most salient ones: validation, ethics, and potential
public policy take-aways.

5.1 Validation
Scientiﬁc measurements should be amenable to valida-
tion. Unfortunately, here, ground truth is rarely avail-
able, which in turn makes validation extremely difﬁcult.
Marketplace operators indeed generally do not publish
metrics such as seller numbers or trafﬁc volumes. How-
ever, in certain cases, we have limited information that
we can use for spot-checking estimates.

Ross Ulbricht trial evidence (Silk Road)
In October
2013, a San Francisco man by the name of Ross Ul-
bricht was arrested and charged as being the operator of
Silk Road [8]. A large amount of data was subsequently
entered into evidence used during his trial, which took
place in January 2015. In particular, evidence contained
relatively detailed accounting entries found on Mr. Ul-
bricht’s laptop, and claimed to pertain to Silk Road. Chat
transcripts (evidence GX226A, GX227C) place weekly
volumes at $475,000/week in late March 2012 for in-
stance:
this is consistent with the data previously re-
ported [13] and which we use for documenting Silk Road
1. Evidence GX250 contains a personal ledger which

USENIX Association  

24th USENIX Security Symposium  45

13

apparently faithfully documents Silk Road sales com-
missions. Projecting the data listed during the time of
the previous study [13] ($680,279) over a year yields a
yearly projection of about $1.2M; Christin’s estimates
were of $1.1M [13]. This hints that the technique of
using feedback as a sales proxy, which we reuse here,
produces reliable estimates.

Blake Benthall criminal complaint (Silk Road 2)
In
November 2014, another San Francisco man by the name
of Blake Benthall was arrested and charged with being
“Defcon,” the Silk Road 2.0 administrator. The crim-
inal complaint against Mr. Benthall [7] reports that in
September 2014, the administrator, talking to an under-
cover agent actually working on Silk Road 2’s staff, re-
ports around $6M of monthly sales; and later amends this
number to $8M. This corresponds to a daily sales volume
of $200,000–$250,000 which is very close to what we re-
port in Figure 5 for Silk Road 2 at that given time.

Leaked Agora seller page
In December 2014, it was
revealed that an Agora vendor page had been scraped and
leaked on Pastebin [21]. This vendor page in particular
contains a subset of all the vendor’s transactions; one can
estimate precisely the amount for that speciﬁc vendor on
June 5, 2014 to $3,460. Checking in our database, our
instantaneous estimate credits that seller with $3,408 on
the day – which, considering Bitcoin exchange ﬂuctua-
tions is pretty much identical to the ground truth.

5.2 Ethics of data collection

We share much of the ethical concerns and views docu-
mented in previous work [13]. Our data collection, in
particular, is massive, and could potentially put some
strain on the Tor network, not to mention marketplace
servers themselves. However, even though it is hard
to assess we believe that our measurements represent a
small fraction of all trafﬁc that is going to online anony-
mous marketplaces. As discussed in Section 3 we are at-
tempting to balance accuracy of the data collection with a
light-weight enough crawling strategy to avoid detection
– or worse, impacting the very operations we are trying to
measure. In addition, we are contributing Tor relays with
long uptimes on very fast networks to “compensate” for
our own massive use of the network. Our work takes a
number of steps to remain neutral. We certainly do not
want to facilitate vendor or marketplace operator arrests.
This is not just an ethical question, but is also a scientiﬁc
one: our measurements, to be sound, should not impact
the subject(s) being measured [23].

5.3 Public-policy take-aways
The main outcome of this work, we hope, is a criti-
cal evaluation of meaningful public policy toward online
anonymous marketplaces. While members of Congress
have routinely called for the take down of “brazen” on-
line marketplaces, it is unclear that this is the most prag-
matic use of taxpayer money.

In fact, our measurements suggest that the ecosystem
appears quite resilient to law enforcement take-downs.
We see this without ambiguity in response to the (origi-
nal) Silk Road take-down; and while it is too early to tell
the long-lasting impacts of Operation Onymous, its main
effect so far seems to have been to consolidate transac-
tions in the two dominant marketplaces at the time of the
take-down. More generally, economics tell us that be-
cause user demand for drugs online is present (and quite
massive), enterprising individuals will seemingly always
be interested in accommodating this demand.

A natural question is whether the cat-and-mouse game
between law enforcement and marketplace operators
could end with the complete demise of online anony-
mous marketplaces. Our results suggest it is unlikely.
Thus, considering the expenses incurred in very lengthy
investigations and the level of international coordination
needed in operations like Operation Onymous, the time
may be ripe to investigate alternative solutions.

Reducing demand through prevention is certainly an
alternative worth exploring on a global public policy
level, but, from a law enforcement perspective, even ac-
tive intervention could be much more targeted, e.g., to-
ward seizing highly dangerous products while in transit.
A number of documented successes in using traditional
police work against sellers of hazardous substances (e.g.,
[35]) or large-scale dealers (e.g., [4, 6] among many oth-
ers) show that law enforcement is not powerless to ad-
dress the issue in the physical world.

6 Related work

The past decade has seen a large number of detailed re-
search efforts aiming at gathering actual measurements
from various online criminal ecosystems in order to de-
vise meaningful defenses; see, e.g., [13,14,22,26,27,28,
29,32,40,41]. Anderson et al. [11] and Thomas et al. [37]
provide a very good overview of the ﬁeld. Closest among
these papers to our work, McCoy et al. obtained detailed
measurements of online pharmaceutical afﬁliates, show-
ing that individual networks grossed between USD 12.8
million/year to USD 67.7 million/year. In comparison,
the long-term rough average we see here is in the order of
$150–180M/year for the entire online anonymous mar-
ketplace ecosystem. In other words, online marketplaces
have seemingly surpassed more “traditional” ways of de-

livering illicit narcotics.

With respect

to speciﬁc measurements of online
anonymous marketplaces, the present paper builds up
on our previous work [13]. Surprisingly few other ef-
forts exist attempting to quantitatively characterize the
economics of online anonymous marketplaces. Of note,
Aldridge and D´ecary-H´etu [10] complement our original
volume estimates by showing revised numbers of around
$90M/year for Silk Road in 2013 right before its take-
down. This is roughly in line with our own measure-
ments, albeit slightly more conservative (Figure 5 shows
about $300K/day for Silk Road in summer 2013.) More
recent work by Dolliver [17] tries to assess the volumes
on Silk Road 2.0. While she does not report volumes, her
seller numbers are far smaller than ours, and we suspect
her scrapes might have been incomplete. Looking at the
problem from a different angle, Meiklejohn et al. [31]
provide a detailed analysis of transaction traceability in
the Bitcoin network, and show which addresses are re-
lated to Silk Road, which in turn could be a useful way of
assessing the total volumes of that marketplace. A follow
up paper [30] shows that purported Bitcoin “anonymity”
(i.e., unlinkability) is greatly overstated, even when us-
ing newer mixing primitives.

On the customer side, Barratt et al. [12] provide an
insightful survey of Silk Road patrons, showing that a
lot of them associate with the “party culture,” which is
corroborated by our results showing that cannabis and
ecstasy correspond to roughly half of the sales; like-
wise Van Hout and Bingham provide valuable insights
into individual participants [39]. Our research comple-
ments these efforts by providing a macro-level view of
the ecosystem.

7 Conclusions

Even though anonymous online marketplaces are a rel-
atively recent development in the overall online crime
ecosystem, our longitudinal measurements show that in
the short four years since the development of the original
Silk Road, total volumes have reached up to $700,000
daily (averaged over 30-day windows) and are generally
stable around $300,000-$500,000 a day, far exceeding
what had been previously reported. More remarkably,
anonymous marketplaces are extremely resilient to take-
downs and scams – highlighting the simple fact that eco-
nomics (demand) plays a dominant role. In light of our
ﬁndings, we suggest a re-evaluation of intervention poli-
cies against anonymous marketplaces. Given the high
demand for the products being sold, it is not clear that
take-downs will be effective; at least we have found no
evidence they were. Even if one went to the impracti-
cal extreme of banning anonymous networks, demand
would probably simply move to other channels, while

some of the beneﬁts associated with these markets (e.g.,
reduction in risks of violence at the retail level) would be
lost. Instead, a focus on reducing consumer demand, e.g.,
through prevention, might be worth considering; like-
wise, it would be well-worth investigating whether more
targeted interventions (e.g., at the seller level) have had
measurable effects on the overall ecosystem. While our
paper does not answer these questions, we believe that
the data collection methodology we described, as well as
some of the data we have collected, may enable further
research in the ﬁeld.
