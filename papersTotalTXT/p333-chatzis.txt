ABSTRACT
In the context of measuring the Internet, a long-standing question
has been whether there exist well-localized physical entities in to-
day’s network where trafﬁc from a representative cross-section of
the constituents of the Internet can be observed at a ﬁne-enough
granularity to paint an accurate and informative picture of how
these constituents shape and impact much of the structure and evo-
lution of today’s Internet and the actual trafﬁc it carries.

In this paper, we ﬁrst answer this question in the afﬁrmative by
mining 17 weeks of continuous sFlow data from one of the largest
European IXPs. Examining these weekly snapshots, we discover
a vantage point with excellent visibility into the Internet, seeing
week-in and week-out trafﬁc from all 42K+ routed ASes, almost
all 450K+ routed preﬁxes, from close to 1.5M servers, and around
a quarter billion IPs from all around the globe. Second, to show
the potential of such vantage points, we analyze the server-related
portion of the trafﬁc at this IXP, identify the server IPs and cluster
them according to the organizations responsible for delivering the
content. In the process, we observe a clear trend among many of
the critical Internet players towards network heterogenization; that
is, either hosting servers of third-party networks in their own infras-
tructures or pursuing massive deployments of their own servers in
strategically chosen third-party networks. While the latter is a well-
known business strategy of companies such as Akamai, Google,
and Netﬂix, we show in this paper the extent of network heteroge-
nization in today’s Internet and illustrate how it enriches the tradi-
tional, largely trafﬁc-agnostic AS-level view of the Internet.

INTRODUCTION

An ever-growing demand for Web-based trafﬁc [30, 41] (e. g.,
HD video and other streaming media, e-commerce services), to-
gether with the proliferation of new Internet-enabled devices and
the emergence of new content distribution models and cloud infras-
tructure providers are radically transforming the nature of content
delivery in today’s Internet. These features are also having a pro-
found impact on how some of the main Internet players (e. g., ISPs,
CDNs, Web hosting companies, and content providers) operate in
such a dynamic environment and do business in an increasingly
competitive marketplace. Unfortunately, carefully tracking these
developments to obtain an accurate picture of how this critical cast
of players shapes and impacts much of the Internet and its trafﬁc
has become an increasingly daunting task. In the past, attempts at
painting such a picture had limited success because they typically
relied on piecing together incomplete and often inaccurate informa-
tion from many different sources of varying quality [40, 45, 50] or
using various types of hard-to-get (i. e., proprietary) datasets [41]
or hard-to-justify estimates of difﬁcult-to-measure (e. g., inter-AS
trafﬁc matrix) quantities [27].

A main reason for our current inability to accurately track a con-
stantly changing Internet has been the lack of global vantage points
where trafﬁc from a sufﬁciently large portion of the Internet can be
observed at a granularity that is sufﬁciently ﬁne-grained to discern
the make up of today’s Internet trafﬁc and the interactions of the
responsible parties. This raises the questions whether or not such
vantage points do indeed exist in today’s Internet, and if so, what
exactly they enable us to discern about the Internet as a whole as
well as its individual constituents?

Main contribution (part 1): The ﬁrst ﬁnding reported in this
paper is that some of the largest Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in
Europe (i. e., AMS-IX in Amsterdam, DE-CIX in Frankfurt, LINX
in London) do indeed serve as the kind of vantage points we are
looking for. In particular, our detailed analysis of 17 contiguous
weeks of complete sFlow measurements from one of the largest
European IXPs reveals that in addition to being a critical part of the

333European portion of the Internet, this IXP also plays a global role,
“seeing” trafﬁc from a large fraction of the Internet. To highlight
the kind of visibility into the Internet as a whole that is possible at
these vantage points, we show that week-in and week-out, our IXP
“sees” trafﬁc from all 42K+ routed ASes, almost all 450K+ routed
preﬁxes, from about 1.5M servers, and around a quarter billion IP
addresses from all the countries around the globe. Importantly, the
fact that these largest European IXPs all operate in a very similar
fashion, handle comparable trafﬁc volumes, and have similar pro-
ﬁles with respect to the members and range of service offerings
allows us to conclude that either one of them ﬁts the role of being
a global Internet vantage point.

However, like all vantage points used in practice, visibility from
these large European IXPs into the Internet is not perfect. Thus,
knowing what we cannot discern about what aspects of the Inter-
net from mining the trafﬁc seen at one of these vantage points is as
important as knowing what we can discern. To deal with this im-
portant issue, we consider a variety of different IXP-external mea-
surements that not only complement the IXPs own data, but also
enable us to either check or validate our ﬁndings that are based on
the IXPs data alone or help us determine what aspects are impossi-
ble to discern from this vantage point, and why.

Main contribution (part 2): Our second main ﬁnding illustrates
the new opportunities or beneﬁts for Internet measurements that
arise from having access to vantage points with such good visi-
bility into the Internet. By squarely focusing on the analysis of
the Web server-related portion of the trafﬁc “seen” by our IXP and
applying an original methodology for identifying server-based in-
frastructures, classifying them by ownership (e. g., company, orga-
nization), and associating trafﬁc with them, we show that many of
the major commercial Internet players are actively contributing to a
clearly discernible trend towards network heterogenization. That is,
many of these players’ networks are undergoing major changes as
a result of business decisions that either favor the hosting of servers
from third-party networks within their own network infrastructures
or the deployment of their own servers, often in massive numbers,
in purposefully-selected third-party networks.

On the one hand, this ﬁnding simply conﬁrms what is well-
documented in press releases of some of the main commercial In-
ternet players and technology blogs, but remains a largely under-
reported issue in the networking research literature. For example,
it is well-known that CDN companies such as Akamai are accel-
erating the deployment of their own servers in eyeball networks
by forming strategic content delivery alliances with large ISPs [1,
6]. Similarly, it is also widely reported that large content providers
such as Netﬂix are installing their own brand of single-purpose
CDNs (e. g., Netﬂix’s Open Connect) inside various regional and
local ISPs for the sole purpose of enabling those ISPs to deliver
Netﬂix video data directly to their end users [5]. Other key compa-
nies such as Google, Amazon, or Facebook have followed suit and
further add to the complexities that result from this proliferation of
intertwined network infrastructures and trafﬁc.

On the other hand, by providing a methodology for discover-
ing an organization’s servers, whether they are deployed within
the organization’s own AS (or ASes) or inside some third-party
network’s infrastructure, we enable and advocate a measurement-
driven approach to inferring and assessing the extent to which in-
dividual network infrastructures or the trafﬁc that they carry are
heterogeneous. The results of our study show that network het-
erogenization is wide-spread and not just conﬁned to well-known
players such as Akamai or Google. We also study the impact that
this ﬁnding has on the usage of peering links at IXPs, in particu-
lar, and AS-links in the larger Internet, in general. Speciﬁcally, we

show that not only is AS-link usage becoming more heterogeneous,
but the task of attributing trafﬁc to the party responsible for it faces
enormous challenges in view of the complexities that result from
the observed proliferation of intertwined network infrastructures
and trafﬁc. In effect, these ﬁndings argue that future attempts at
accurately and meaningfully studying the business strategies of the
various Internet constituents (e. g., ISPs, content providers, CDNs,
IXPs, networks without an ASN, resellers, etc.) and the business
relationships among them have to move beyond the traditional and
largely trafﬁc-agnostic AS-level view of the Internet. They must
account for the complexities that result from today’s Internet re-
alities and are more concerned with how trafﬁc ﬂows across the
network than with how the network is connected at the AS level.

Head-on comparison with [13]: The large European IXP con-
sidered in this paper also featured prominently in the recent work
by Ager et al. [13]. However, while that study focused squarely on
the discovery of a surprisingly rich peering fabric among the mem-
ber ASes of that IXP, in this paper, we are mainly concerned with
mining the trafﬁc seen at this IXP to determine the IXP’s visibil-
ity into the Internet. Put differently, while [13] exploited the IXP
measurements to obtain an accurate picture of the “inside” of this
IXP (i. e., its member ASes, their peerings, and the IXP-speciﬁc
trafﬁc matrix), this paper mines recent trafﬁc data to obtain a view
of the “outside” of the IXP; that is, the larger Internet beyond the
boundary formed by the members of the IXP. In terms of results,
while [13] highlighted the severe level of incompleteness of the
commonly-studied AS maps of the Internet, this paper establishes
and provides concrete evidence for why and in what sense this tra-
ditional AS-level view— although still useful for exploring and un-
derstanding various connectivity- or reachability-related aspects—
is largely inept for accounting for critical elements of the networks
that make up today’s Internet. Thus, representing two largely com-
plementary efforts, the combined ﬁndings of [13] and of this paper
take the observations of the study by Labovitz et al. [41] to the next
level.
In the process, we identify and outline an alternative and
largely orthogonal perspective to the traditional AS-level view that
centers around organizations or companies and their server-based
infrastructures that are spread across many networks and countries
and defy traditional network and geographic boundaries.

Road-map: The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we describe the available IXP measurements and re-
port on how we extract the relevant trafﬁc data for our study. We
focus in Section 3 on our ﬁrst ﬁnding that the IXP deﬁnes a vantage
point that offers unprecedented visibility into the Internet, and we
support this ﬁnding with concrete results based on a week’s worth
of trafﬁc. Our results are complemented in Section 4 by a longi-
tudinal analysis, and we discuss what measurements taken at this
single vantage point for a 17-week long period reveal about the In-
ternet. In Section 5, we describe our methodology for grouping an
organization’s servers, irrespective of their location within the In-
ternet, and report on our second main ﬁnding; that is, evidence for
and extent of network heterogenization. We continue in Section 6
with a discussion of related and future work and conclude with a
summary of our main observations in Section 7.

we rely on throughout this paper to show what we can and cannot
discern from the IXP-internal measurements alone.1
2.1 Available IXP-internal datasets

The work reported in this paper is based on trafﬁc measurements
collected between August 27 (beginning of week 35) and Decem-
ber 23 (end of week 51) of 2012 at one of the largest IXPs in Eu-
rope. At the beginning of the measurement period in week 35,
this IXP had 443 member ASes that exchanged on average some
11.9 PB of trafﬁc per day over the IXP’s public peering infras-
tructure (i. e., a layer-2 switching fabric distributed over a num-
ber of data centers within the city where the IXP is located). Dur-
ing the measurement period, the IXP added between 1-2 members
per week. Speciﬁcally, the measurements we rely on consist of
17 consecutive weeks of uninterrupted anonymized sFlow records
that contain Ethernet frame samples that were collected using a ran-
dom sampling of 1 out of 16K. sFlow captures the ﬁrst 128 bytes
of each sampled frame. This implies that in the case of IPv4 pack-
ets the available information consists of the full IP and transport
layer headers and 74 and 86 bytes of TCP and UDP payload, re-
spectively. For further details about the IXP infrastructure itself as
well as the collected sFlow measurements (e. g., absence of sam-
pling bias), we refer to [13]. In the following, we use our week 45
data to illustrate our method. The other weekly snapshots produce
very similar results and are discussed in more detail in Section 4.
2.2 Methods for dissecting the IXP’s trafﬁc

2.2.1 Peering trafﬁc
Figure 1 details the ﬁltering steps that we applied to the raw
sFlow records collected at this IXP to obtain what we refer to as
the “peering trafﬁc” component of the overall trafﬁc. As shown
in Figure 1, after removing from the overall trafﬁc, in succession,
all non-IPv4 trafﬁc (i. e., native IPv6 and other protocols; roughly
0.4% of the total trafﬁc, most of which is native IPv6), all trafﬁc
that is either not member-to-member or stays local (e. g., IXP man-
agement trafﬁc; about 0.6%), all member-to-member IPv4 trafﬁc
that is not TCP or UDP (i. e., ICMP and other transport protocols;
less than 0.5%), this peering trafﬁc makes up more than 98.5% of
the total trafﬁc. As an interesting by-product, we observe that 82%
of the peering trafﬁc is TCP and 18% is UDP.

2.2.2 Web server-related trafﬁc
We next identify the portion of the peering trafﬁc that can be un-
ambiguously identiﬁed as Web server-related trafﬁc. Our motiva-
tion is that Web servers are generally considered to be the engines

1For an overview of the importance of IXPs for today’s Internet,
we refer to [28].

of e-commerce, which in turn argues that Web server-related trafﬁc
is, in general, a good proxy for the commercial portion of Internet
trafﬁc. Accordingly, we focus on HTTP and HTTPS and describe
the ﬁltering steps for extracting their trafﬁc.

To identify HTTP trafﬁc, we rely primarily on commonly-used
string-matching techniques applied to the content of the 128 bytes
of each sampled frame. We use two different patterns. The ﬁrst
pattern matches the initial line of request and response packets and
looks for HTTP method words (e. g., GET, HEAD, POST) and the
words HTTP/1.{0,1}. The second pattern applies to header lines
in any packet of a connection and relies on commonly used HTTP
header ﬁeld words as documented in the relevant RFCs and W3C
speciﬁcations (e. g., Host, Server, Access-Control-Allow-Methods).
Using these techniques enables us to identify which of the IP end-
points act as servers and which ones act as clients. When applied to
our week 45 data, we identify about 1.3 million server IPs together
with roughly 40 million client IPs. Checking the port numbers, we
verify that more than 80% of the server IPs use the expected TCP
ports, i. e., 80 and 8080. Some 5% of them also use 1935 (RTMP)
as well as 443 (HTTPS). Note that by relying on string-matching,
we miss those servers for which our sFlow records do not contain
sufﬁcient information; we also might mis-classify as clients some
of those servers that “talk” with other servers and for which only
their client-related activity is captured in our data.

With respect to HTTPS trafﬁc, since we cannot use pattern match-
ing directly due to encryption, we use a mixed passive and active
measurement approach. In a ﬁrst step, we use trafﬁc on TCP port
443 to identify a candidate set of IPs of HTTPS servers. Here,
we clearly miss HTTPS servers that do not use port 443, but we
consider them not to be commercially relevant. However, given
that TCP port 443 is commonly used to circumvent ﬁrewalls and
proxy rules for other kinds of trafﬁc (e. g., SSH servers or VPNs
running TCP port 443), in a second step we rule out non-HTTPS
related use by relying on active measurements. For this purpose,
we crawl each IP in our candidate set for an X.509 certiﬁcate chain
and check the validity of the returned X.509 certiﬁcates. For those
IPs that pass the checks of the certiﬁcate, we extract the names for
which the X.509 certiﬁcate is valid and the purpose for which it
was issued. In particular, we check the following properties in each
retrieved X.509 certiﬁcate: (a) certiﬁcate subject, (b) alternative
names, (c) key usage (purpose), (d) certiﬁcate chain, (e) validity
time, and (f) stability over time. If a certiﬁcate does not pass any of
the tests, we do not consider it in the analysis.

We keep only the IPs that have a certiﬁcate subject and alterna-
tive names with valid domains and also valid country-code second-
level domains (ccSLD) according to the deﬁnition in [35]. Next,
we check if the key usage explicitly indicates a Web server role. In
the certiﬁcate chain we check if the delivered certiﬁcates do really
refer to each other in the right order they are listed up to the root
certiﬁcate, which must be contained in the current Linux/Ubuntu
white-list. Next, we verify the validity time of each certiﬁcate in
the chain by comparing it to the timestamp the certiﬁcate fetching
was performed. Lastly, we perform the active measurements sev-
eral times and check for changes because IPs in cloud deployments
can change their role very quickly and frequently. Ignoring validity
time, we require that all the certiﬁcates fetched from a single IP
have the same properties. In the case of our week 45 data, start-
ing with a candidate set of approximately 1.5M IPs, some 500K
respond to repeated active measurements, of which 250K are in the
end identiﬁed as HTTPS server IPs.

When combined, these ﬁltering steps yield approximately 1.5M
different Web server IPs (including the 250K HTTPS server IPs).
In total, these HTTP and HTTPS server IPs are responsible for or

Figure 2: Trafﬁc per server IP sorted by trafﬁc share

“see” more than 70% of the peering trafﬁc portion of the total traf-
ﬁc. Some 350K of these IP addresses appear in both sets and are
examples of multi-purpose servers; that is, servers with one IP ad-
dress that see activity on multiple ports. Multi-purpose servers are
popular with commercial Internet players (e.g., Akamai which uses
TCP port 80 (HTTP) and TCP port 1935 (RTMP)), and their pres-
ence in our data partially explains why we see a larger percentage
of Web server-related trafﬁc than what is typically reported in the
literature [33, 36, 43], but is often based on a strictly port-based
trafﬁc classiﬁcation [30, 41].

Among the identiﬁed HTTP and HTTPS server IPs, we ﬁnd
some 200K IPs that act both as servers and as clients. These are
responsible for some 10% of the server-related trafﬁc. Upon closer
inspection of the top contributors in this category, we ﬁnd that they
typically belong to major CDNs (e. g., EdgeCast, Limelight) or net-
work operators (e. g., Eweka). Thus, the large trafﬁc share of these
servers is not surprising and reﬂects typical machine-to-machine
trafﬁc associated with operating, for example, a CDN. Another
class of IPs in this category are proxies or clients that are managed
via a server interface (or vice versa).

In the context of this paper, it is important to clarify the notion of
a server IP. Throughout this paper, a server IP is deﬁned as a pub-
licly routed IP address of a server. As such, it can represent many
different real-world scenarios, including a single (multi-purpose)
server, a rack of multiple servers, or a front-end server acting as
a gateway to possibly thousands of back-end servers (e.g., an en-
tire data center). In fact, Figure 2 shows the trafﬁc share of each
server IP seen in the week 45 data. It highlights the presence of
individual server IPs that are responsible for more than 0.5% of all
server–related trafﬁc! Indeed, the top 34 server IPs are responsi-
ble for more than 6% of the overall server trafﬁc. These server IPs
cannot be single machines. Upon closer examination, they are iden-
tiﬁed as belonging to a cast of Internet players that includes CDNs,
large content providers, streamers, virtual backbone providers, and
resellers, and thus represent front-end servers to large data centers
and/or anycast services. Henceforth, we use the term server to refer
to a server IP as deﬁned above.
2.3 Available IXP-external datasets

When appropriate and feasible, we augment our IXP-based ﬁnd-
ings with active and passive measurements that do not involve the
IXP in any form or shape and are all collected in parallel to our
IXP data collection. Such complementary information allows us to
verify, check, or reﬁne the IXP-based ﬁndings.

One example of a complementary IXP-external dataset is a pro-
prietary dataset from a large European Tier-1 ISP consisting of
packet-level trafﬁc traces.2 With the help of the network intrusion
detection system Bro [47] we produce the HTTP and DNS logs,
extract the Web server-related trafﬁc and the corresponding server
IPs from the logs, and rely on the resulting data in Section 3.

For another example, we use the list of the top 280K DNS recur-
sive resolvers—as seen by one of the largest commercial CDNs—
as a starting set to ﬁnd a highly distributed set of DNS resolvers that
are available for active measurements such as doing reverse DNS
lookups or performing active DNS queries. From this initial list
of DNS servers, we eliminate those that cannot be used for active
measurements (i.e., those that are not open, delegate DNS resolu-
tions to other resolvers, or provide incorrect answers) and end up
with a ﬁnal list of about 25K DNS resolvers in some 12K ASes that
are used for active measurements in Section 3.3.

Other examples of IXP-external data we use in this work include
the publicly available lists of the top-1M or top-1K popular Web
sites that can be downloaded from www.alexa.com. We ob-
tained these lists for each of the weeks for which we have IXP
data. We also utilized blogs and technical information found on the
ofﬁcial Web sites of the various technology companies and Internet
players. In addition, we make extensive use of publicly available
BGP-based data that is collected on an ongoing basis by Route-
Views [8], RIPE RIS [7], Team Cymru [9], etc.
2.4 IP server meta-data

Our efforts in Section 5 rely on certain meta-data that we collect
for server IPs and that is obtained from DNS information, URIs,
and X.509 certiﬁcates from HTTPS servers.

Regarding DNS information, obvious meta-information is the
hostname(s) of a server IP. This information is useful because large
organizations [38] often follow industrial standards in their naming
schema’s for servers that they operate or host in their own networks.
Another useful piece of meta-data is the Start of Authority (SOA)
resource record which relates to the administrative authority and
can be resolved iteratively. This way one can often ﬁnd a common
root for organizations that do not use a uniﬁed naming schema.
Note that the SOA record is often present, even when there is no
hostname record available or an ARPA address is returned in the
reverse lookup of a server IP.

Next, the URI as well as the authority associated with the host-
name give us hints regarding the organization that is responsible
for the content. For example, for the URI youtube.com, one
ﬁnds the SOA resource record google.com and thus can asso-
ciate Youtube with Google.

Lastly, the X.509 certiﬁcates reveal several useful pieces of meta-
data. First, they list the base set of URIs that can be served by the
corresponding server IP. Second, some server IPs have certiﬁcates
with multiple names that can be used to ﬁnd additional URIs. This
is typically the case for hosting companies that host multiple sites
on a single server IP. In addition, it is used by CDNs that serve
multiple different domains with the same physical infrastructure.
Moreover, the names found in the certiﬁcates can be mapped to
SOA resource records as well.

Overall, we are able to extract DNS information for 71.7%, at
least one URI for 23.8%, and X.509 certiﬁcate information for
17.7% of the 1.5M server IPs that we see in our week 45 data. For
81.9% of all the server IPs, we have at least one of the three pieces
of information. For example, for streamers, one typically has no

ing the analysis with the network intrusion detection system Bro.
We always use a preﬁx preserving function when anonymizing IPs.

meta-data in Section 5, we clean it by removing non-valid URIs,

such as ripe.net, etc. This cleaning effort reduces the pool of
server IPs by less than 3%.

3. LOCAL YET GLOBAL

The main purpose of this section is to show that our IXP repre-
sents an intriguing vantage point, with excellent visibility into the
Internet as a whole. This ﬁnding of the IXP’s important global role
complements earlier observations that have focused on the impor-
tant local role that this large European IXP plays for the greater
geographic region where it is located [13], and we further elabo-
rate here on its dual role as a local and as a global player. Impor-
tantly, we also discuss what we can and cannot discern about the
Internet as a whole or its individual constituents based on measure-
ments taken at this vantage point. The reported numbers are for
the week 45 measurements when the IXP had 452 members that
exchanged some 14 PB of trafﬁc per day and are complemented by
a longitudinal analysis in Section 4.
3.1 On the global role of the IXP

By providing a well-deﬁned set of steps and requirements for es-
tablishing peering links between member networks, IXPs clearly
satisfy the main reason for why they exist in the ﬁrst place – keep-
ing local trafﬁc local. To assess the visibility into the global Inter-
net that comes with using a large European IXP as a vantage point,
we focus on the peering trafﬁc component (see Section 2.2.1) and
summarize in Table 1 the pertinent results.

First, in this single geographically well-localized facility, we ob-
serve during a one-week period approximately a quarter billion

unique IPv4 addresses (recall that the portion of native IPv6 trafﬁc
seen at this IXP is negligible). While the total number of pub-
licly routed IPv4 addresses in the Internet in any given week is un-
known, it is some portion of the approximately three and a half bil-
lion allocated IPv4 addresses, which suggests that this IXP “sees”
a signiﬁcant fraction of the ground truth. The global role of this
IXP is further illuminated by geo-locating all 230M+ IP addresses
at the country-level granularity [49] and observing that this IXP
“sees” trafﬁc from every country of the world, except for places
such as Western Sahara, Christmas Islands, or Cocos (Keeling) Is-
lands. This ability to see the global Internet from this single van-
tage point is visualized in Figure 3, where the different countries’
shades of gray indicate which percentage of IPs a given country
contributes to the IPs seen at this IXP.

Second, when mapping the encountered 230M+ IP addresses
to more network-speciﬁc entities such as subnets or preﬁxes and
ASes, we conﬁrm the IXP’s ability to “see” the Internet. More
precisely, in terms of subnets/preﬁxes, this IXP “sees” trafﬁc from
445K subnets; that is, from essentially all actively routed preﬁxes.
Determining the precise number of actively routed preﬁxes in the
Internet in any given week remains an imprecise science as it de-
pends on the publicly available BGP data that are traditionally used
in this context (e.g., RouteViews, RIPE). The reported numbers
vary between 450K-500K and are only slightly larger than the 445K
subnets we see in this one week. With respect to ASes, the results
are very similar – the IXP “sees” trafﬁc from some 42.8K actively
routed ASes, where the ground truth for the number of actively
routed ASes in the Internet in any given week is around 43K [3]
and varies slightly with the used BGP dataset.

Lastly, to examine the visibility that this IXP has into the more
commercial-oriented Internet, we next use the Web server-related
component of the IXP’s peering trafﬁc (see Section 2.2.2). Table 1
shows that this IXP “sees” server-related trafﬁc from some 1.5M
IPs that can be unambiguously identiﬁed as Web server IPs. Un-
fortunately, we are not aware of any numbers that can be reliably
considered as ground truth of all server IPs in the Internet in any
given week. Even worse, available white papers or reports that pur-
portedly provide this information are typically very cavalier about
their deﬁnition of what they consider as “Web server” and hence
cannot be taken at face value [40, 50].

To indirectly assess how the roughly 1.5M Web server IPs seen
at this IXP stack up against the unknown number of Web server IPs
Internet-wide, we use an essentially orthogonal dataset, namely the
HTTP and DNS logs from a large European Tier-1 ISP that does not
exchange trafﬁc over the public switching infrastructure of our IXP.
Applying the method as described in Section 2, we extract the Web
server IPs from this ISP dataset and ﬁnd that of the total number of
server IPs that are “seen” by this ISP, only some 45K are not seen at
the IXP. Importantly, for the server IPs seen both at the IXP and the
ISP, those we identiﬁed as server IPs using the IXP-internal data
are conﬁrmed to be indeed server IPs when relying on the more
detailed ISP dataset.
In any case, mapping the 1.5M server IPs
from the IXP to preﬁxes, ASes, and countries shows that this IXP
“sees” server-trafﬁc from some 17% of all actively routed preﬁxes,
from about 50% of all actively routed ASes, and from about 80%
of all the countries in the world.

3.2 On the IXP’s dual role

Visuals such as Figure 3 illustrate that by using this IXP as a van-
tage point, we are able to see peering trafﬁc from every country and
corner of the world or from almost every AS and preﬁx that is pub-
licly routed. However, such ﬁgures do not show whether or not cer-
tain countries or corners and ASes or preﬁxes are better visible than

others in the sense that they are responsible for more trafﬁc that is
exchanged over the public switching fabric of the IXP. In particu-
lar, we would like to know whether the importance of the local role
that this IXP plays for the larger geographic region within which it
is situated is more or less recovered when considering the peering
or server-related trafﬁc that the IPs or server IPs are responsible
for, respectively. To this end, we show in Table 2 the top-10 coun-
tries in terms of percentage of IP addresses (and associated trafﬁc)
and percentage of server IPs (and associated trafﬁc). In addition,
we show the top-10 networks. While the role of the IXP for the
European region becomes more dominant when we change from
peering to server-related trafﬁc, there are still prominent signs of
the IXP’s global role, even with respect to the commercial Internet,
and they reﬂect the relative importance of this IXP for countries
such as USA, Russia, and China or ASes such as 20940 (Akamai),
15169 (Google), and 47541 (VKontakte).

For a somewhat simpliﬁed illustration of the IXP’s dual role as a
local as well as global player, we divide the set of all actively routed
ASes into three disjoint sets, A(L), A(M ), and A(G). A(L) con-
sists of the member ASes of the IXP; A(M ) consists of all ASes
that are distance 1 (measured in AS-hops) from a member AS; and

A(G) is the complement of A(L) ∪ A(M ) and contains those
ASes that are distance 2 or more from the member ASes.
Intu-
itively, the set A(L) captures the importance of the local role of the
IXP, whereas the set A(G) is more a reﬂection of the IXP’s global
role, with A(M) covering some middle ground. Table 3 shows the
breakdown of the IPs, preﬁxes, and ASes for peering trafﬁc and
Web server-related trafﬁc, respectively, for the three sets. It basi-
cally conﬁrms our above observation that there is a general trend
towards the set A(L) as we move from IPs and the peering trafﬁc
they are responsible for to server IPs and their trafﬁc. Note, while
the relative importance of the IXP’s local role over its global role
with respect to the commercial Internet (i.e., server-related trafﬁc)
makes economic sense and is well-captured by this cartoon pic-
ture, in reality, there is potentially signiﬁcant overlap between the
sets A(L), A(M ), and A(G), e. g., due to remote peerings, IXP
resellers, and non-European networks joining the IXP for purely
economic reasons. But this is unlikely to invalidate our basic ﬁnd-
ings concerning the IXP’s dual role.

3.3 On the IXP’s “blind spots”

While the IXP “sees” trafﬁc from much of the Internet, taking
measurements exclusively at this single vantage point can tell us
only so much about the network as a whole or its individual con-
stituents. Hence, knowing what we can discern about the network
with what sort of accuracy is as important as understanding what
we cannot discern about it, and why.

We show in Section 3.1 how the use of an essentially orthogonal
IXP-external dataset (i. e., the HTTP and DNS logs from the large
European Tier-1 ISP) enables us to indirectly assess how the ap-
proximately 1.5M server IPs seen at the IXP in a given week com-
pare to the unknown number of server IPs network-wide. In the
following, we discuss additional examples where the use of IXP-
external data, either in the form publicly available measurements,
active or passive measurements, or proprietary information, enables
us to check, validate, or reﬁne what we can say with certainty when
relying solely on IXP measurements.

To examine in more detail how the approximately 1.5M server
IPs seen at the IXP in a given week compare to all server IPs in the
Internet, we now use a more extensive combination of IXP-external
measurements. To start, using the list of the top-1M Web sites avail-
able from www.alexa.com and based on the URIs retrieved from
the limited payload part of the sampled frames at the IXP, we re-
cover about 20% of all the second-level domains on Alexa’s top-1M
list of sites; this percentage increases to 63% if we consider only the
top-10K list and to 80% for the top-1K. Note that many hostnames
on these lists are dynamic and/or ephemeral. Next, to assess how
many additional server IPs we can identify using the approximately
80% of domains we cannot recover using the URIs seen at the IXP,
we rely on active measurements in the form of DNS queries to those
uncovered domains using our set of 25K DNS resolvers across 12K
ASes (see Section 2.3). From this pool of resolvers, we assign 100
randomly-selected resolvers to each URI. This results in approxi-
mately 600K server IPs, of which more then 360K are already seen
at the IXP and identiﬁed as servers.

To provide insight into the remaining 240K server IPs that are
not seen as a server at the IXP, we classify them into four distinct
categories. First, there are servers of CDNs that are hosted inside
an AS and serve exclusively clients in that AS (“private clusters”).
These servers reply only to resolvers of that AS for content that is
delivered by the global footprint of those CDNs. Trafﬁc to these
servers should not be observable at the IXP as it should stay inter-
nal to the AS. Second, there are servers of CDNs or cloud/hosting
providers that are located geographically far away from the IXP. If

338these networks have a global footprint and distribute content in a
region-aware manner, it is unlikely that these server IPs are seen
at the IXP. The third group includes servers that some ASes oper-
ate for the sole purpose of handling invalid URIs. Finally, the last
category contains those servers of small organizations and/or uni-
versities in parts of the world that are geographically far away from
the IXP. These IPs are typically not visible at the IXP. In terms of
importance, the ﬁrst two categories account for more than 40% of
the 240K servers not seen at the IXP.

For a concrete example for illustrating “what we know we don’t
know”, we consider Akamai. In our week-long IXP dataset, we
observe some 28K server IPs for Akamai in 278 ASes (for details,
see Section 5). However, Akamai publicly states that it operates
some 100K servers in more than 1K ASes [15]. The reasons why
we cannot see this ground truth relying solely on our IXP-internal
data are twofold and mentioned above. First Akamai is known to
operate “private clusters” in many third-party networks which are
generally not visible outside those ASes and therefore cannot be
detected at the IXP. Second, we cannot expect to uncover Akamai’s
footprint in regions that are geographically far away from the IXP,
mainly because Akamai uses sophisticated mechanisms to localize
trafﬁc [42, 46]. Akamai’s large footprint makes discovering all of
its servers difﬁcult, but by performing our own diligently chosen
IXP-external active measurements [39] that utilize the URIs col-
lected in the IXP and the open resolvers discussed in Section 2.3,
we were able to discover about 100K servers in 700 ASes. Thus,
even for a challenging case like Akamai, knowing what our IXP-
internal data can and cannot tell us about its many servers and un-
derstanding the underlying reasons is feasible.

Regarding our assumption that server-related trafﬁc is a good
proxy for the commercial portion of Internet trafﬁc, there are clearly
components of this commercial trafﬁc that are not visible at the IXP.
For example, the recently introduced hybrid CDNs (e. g., Akamai’s
NetSession [12]) serve content by servers as well as by end users
that have already downloaded part of the content. Since the con-
nections between users are not based on a HTTP/HTTPS server-
client architecture but are P2P-based, we may not see them at the
IXP. However, while the trafﬁc of these hybrid CDNs is increas-
ing (e. g., the service is mainly used for large ﬁles such as software
downloads), the overall volume is still very low [31].

Lastly, by the very deﬁnition of an IXP, any trafﬁc that does not
pass through the IXP via its public-facing switching infrastructure
remains entirely invisible to us. For example, this includes all traf-
ﬁc that traverses the IXP over private peering links. IXPs keep the
private peering infrastructure separate from its public peering plat-
form, and we are not aware of any kind of estimates of the amount
of private peering trafﬁc handled by the IXPs.
Summary: By analyzing in detail the trafﬁc that traverses the phys-
ical infrastructure of one of the largest IXPs in Europe, we provide
evidence that the large European IXPs such as AMS-IX, DE-CIX,
and LINX represent global Internet vantage points that “see” week-
in and week-out trafﬁc from hundreds of millions of IPs, from al-
most all routed preﬁxes and from all routed ASes, and from es-
sentially every country around the world. We also illustrate these
IXPs’ dual role as a global and a local player within the Internet’s
ecosystem and caution that despite their outstanding visibility into
the Internet, their use as global Internet vantage points comes with
caveats (e. g., having “blind spots”).

4. STABLE YET CHANGING

In this section, we report on a longitudinal analysis that covers
17 consecutive weeks and describes what using our large IXP as
a vantage point through time enables us to say about the network

as whole, about some of its constituents, and about the trafﬁc that
these constituents are responsible for.

4.1 Stability in the face of constant growth

Publicly available data shows that during 2012, this IXP has ex-
perienced signiﬁcant growth, increasing the number of member
ASes by 75 and seeing the average daily trafﬁc volume grow by
0.1%. In terms of absolute numbers, we see in week 35 a total of
443 IXP member ASes sending an average daily trafﬁc volume of
11.9 PB over the IXP’s public-facing switching infrastructure. By
week 51, the member count stood at 457, and the average trafﬁc
volume went up to 14.5 PB/day. For what follows, it is impor-
tant to note that these newly added member ASes are typically re-
gional and local ISPs or organizations and small companies outside
of central Europe for which membership at this IXP makes eco-
nomic sense. To contrast, all the major content providers, CDNs,
Web hosting companies, eyeball ASes, and Tier-1 ISPs have been
members at this IXP for some time, but may have seen upgrades to
higher port speeds since the time they joined.

Given our interest in the commercial Internet and knowing (see
Section 2) that the server-related trafﬁc is more than 70% of the
peering trafﬁc seen at the IXP, we focus in the rest of this paper
on the server-related portion of the IXP trafﬁc. The initial set of
ﬁndings from our longitudinal analysis paints an intriguingly stable
picture of the commercial Internet as seen from our vantage point.
In particular, analyzing in detail each of the 17 weekly snapshots
shows that during every week, we see server-related trafﬁc at this
IXP from about 20K (i. e., about half of all) actively routed ASes,
some 75K or approximately 15% of all actively routed preﬁxes,
and from a pool of server IPs whose absolute size changes only so
slightly but tends to increase in the long term.

This last property is illustrated in Figure 4(a) when focusing only
on the absolute heights of the different bars that represent the to-
tal number of server IPs seen in a given week. When considering
the full version of this ﬁgure, including the within-bar details, Fig-
ure 4(a) visualizes the weekly churn that is inherent in the server
IPs seen at the IXPs. To explain, the ﬁrst bar in Figure 4(a) shows
the approximately 1.4M unique server IPs that we see in week 35.
The next bar shows that same quantity for week 36, but splits it
into two pieces. While the lower (white) piece reﬂects the portion
of all week 36 server IPs that were already seen during week 35,
the upper (black) piece represents the set of server IPs that were
seen for the ﬁrst time during week 36. Starting with week 37, we
show for each week n ∈ {37, 38, . . . ,51} snapshot a bar that has
three pieces stacked on top of one another. While the ﬁrst (bottom,
white) piece represents the server IPs that were seen at the IXP in
each one of the week k snapshot (k = 35, 36, . . . , n), the second
(grey-shaded) piece shows the server IPs that were seen at the IXP
in at least one previous week k snapshot (k = 35, 36, . . . , n − 1),
but not in all; the third (top black) piece represents all server IPs
that were seen at the IXP for the ﬁrst time in week n.

A key take-away from Figure 4(a) is that there is a sizable pool
of server IPs that is seen at the IXP during each and every week
throughout the 17-week long measurement period. In fact, this sta-
ble portion of server IPs that is seen at the IXP week-in and week-
out is about 30% as can be seen by looking at the bottom (white)
portion of the week 51 bar. Instead of requiring for a server IP to
be seen in each and every week, we also consider a more relaxed
notion of stability called recurrence. This recurrent pool of server
IPs consists of all server IPs that, by week 51, have been seen at the
IXP during at least one previous week (but not in each and every
previous week), is represented by the grey-shaded portion of the
week 51 bar, and consists of about 60% of all server IPs seen in

(c) Churn of ASes with servers

Figure 4: Churn of server IPs and ASes that host servers—
weeks 35-51

week 51. Note that the number of server IPs seen for the ﬁrst time
in week n (top black portion) decreases over time and makes up
just about 10% of all server IPs seen in week 51.

To look in more detail at the stable and recurrent pools of server
IPs and examine their churn or evolution during the 17-week long
measurement period, we rely on the GeoLite Country database [44]
to geo-locate the server IPs to the country level and group them by
geographic “region” as follows: DE, US, RU, CN, RoW (rest of
world). Figure 4(b) is similar to Figure 4(a), but shows for each
week the portions of IPs for each of these ﬁve regions and visu-
alizes the make-up of these server IPs in the same way as we did
in Figure 4(a). Note that the shown region-speciﬁc stable portions
in week 51 add up to the 30% number observed in Figure 4(a),
and similarly for the region-speciﬁc recurrent portions in week 51
(their sum adds up to the roughly 60% portion of the recurrent pool
shown in Figure 4(a)). Interestingly, while the stable pool for DE is
consistently about half of the overall stable pool of server IPs seen
at the IXP, that pool is vanishing small for CN, slightly larger for
RU. This is yet another indication of the important role that this
IXP plays for the European part of the Internet.

An even more intriguing aspect of stability is seen when we con-
sider the server-related trafﬁc that the server IPs that we see at the
IXP are responsible for. For one, we ﬁnd that the stable pool of
server IPs is consistently contributing more than 60% of the server-
related trafﬁc. That is, of the server IPs that this IXP “sees” on
a weekly basis, more than 30% of them are not only seen week
after week, but they are also responsible for most of the server-
related trafﬁc that traverses the IXP each week. When consider-
ing the weekly recurrent pools of server IP (grey-shaded segments
in Figure 4(a)), their trafﬁc portions keep increasing, but only to
less than 30% of all server trafﬁc. To examine the make-up of the
server-related trafﬁc attributed to the stable and recurrent pools of
server IPs, respectively, Figure 5 shows for each week n three bars,
each with ﬁve segments corresponding to the ﬁve regions consid-
ered earlier. The ﬁrst bar is for the server-related trafﬁc portion of
all peering trafﬁc that all server IPs see at the IXP in week n; the
second bar reﬂects the server-related trafﬁc portion in week n at-
tributed to the recurrent pool of server IPs in that week, while the
third bar shows the server-related trafﬁc portion in week n that the
stable pool of server IPs is responsible for. From Figure 5, we see
that while the stable and recurrent pools of server IPs from China
are basically invisible at the IXP in terms of their trafﬁc, both US
and Russia have the property that the stable pool of server IPs is
responsible for much all the server-related trafﬁc seen from those
regions at the IXP.

In addition to examining the churn and evolution of the server IPs
seen at the IXP, it is also instructive to study the temporal behavior
of the subnets and ASes that the encountered server IPs map into.
To illustrate, we only consider the ASes and show in Figure 4(c)
for ASes what we depicted in Figure 4(b) for server IPs. The key
difference between server IPs and ASes is that the stable pool of
ASes represented by the white portion of the week 51 bar is about
70% compared to the 30% for the stable pool of server IPs. Thus,
a majority of ASes with server IPs is seen at the IXP during each
and every week, and the number of ASes that are seen for the ﬁrst
time becomes miniscule over time. In summary, the stable pool of
server IPs (about 1/3 of all server IPs seen at the IXP) gives rise to
a stable pool of ASes (about 2/3 of all ASes seen at the IXP and
have server IPs) and is responsible for much of the server-related
trafﬁc seen at the IXP.

4.2 Changes in face of signiﬁcant stability

One beneﬁt of observing a signiﬁcant amount of stability with
respect to the server-related portion of the overall peering trafﬁc
seen at the IXP is that any weekly snapshot provides more or less
the same information. At the same time, subsequent weekly snap-

Figure 5: Churn of server trafﬁc by region—weeks 35-51

shots that differ noticeably may be an indication of some change.
Next, we brieﬂy discuss a few examples of such changes that we
can discern about the Internet as a whole and some of its individual
constituents when we have the luxury to observe and measure the
network at this IXP for a number of consecutive weeks.

The ﬁrst example is motivated primarily by our ability described
in Section 2.2.2 to speciﬁcally look for and identify HTTPS server
IPs, but also by anecdotal evidence or company blogs [21, 22] that
suggest that due to widespread security and privacy concerns, the
use of HTTPS is steadily increasing. To examine this purported
increase, we extract for each weekly snapshot all HTTPS server
IPs and the trafﬁc that they contribute. When comparing for each
week the number of HTTPS server IPs relative to all server IPs
seen in that week and the weekly trafﬁc associated with HTTPS
server IPs relative to all peering trafﬁc, we indeed observe a small,
yet steady increase, which conﬁrms that the Internet landscape is
gradually changing as far as the use of HTTPS is concerned.

For a different kind of example for using our IXP vantage point,
we are interested in tracking the recently announced expansion of
Netﬂix using Amazon’s EC2 cloud service [10] into a number of
Scandinavian countries [23]. To this end, we relied on publicly
available data to obtain Amazon EC2’s data center locations [16]
and the corresponding IP ranges [17]. We then mined our 17 weeks
worth of IXP data and observed for weeks 49, 50, and 51 a pro-
nounced increase in the number of server IPs at Amazon EC2’s
Ireland location, the only data center of Amazon EC2 in Europe.
This was accompanied by a signiﬁcant (but still small in absolute
terms) increase in Amazon EC2’s trafﬁc. All this suggests that it
may be interesting to watch this trafﬁc in the future, especially if
the observed changes are in any way related to Netﬂix becoming
available in Northern Europe towards the end of 2012.

Yet another example concerns the detection of regional or na-
tional events at this IXP. For example, considering in more detail
week 44, which shows up as a clear dip in, say, Figure 4(a), we
notice that this week coincides with Hurricane Sandy that had a
major impact on the US East Coast region. To examine its impact,

we use the IXP vantage point to discern this natural disaster from
trafﬁc that we see at the IXP from a particular Internet constituent,
a major cloud provider. Using publicly available information about
the cloud platform’s data centers and corresponding IP ranges, we
look in our data for the corresponding server IPs and ﬁnd a total of
about 14K. A detailed breakdown by data center location for weeks
43-45 shows a drastic reduction in the number of server IPs seen at
the IXP from the US East Coast region, indicating that the platform
of this major cloud provider faced serious problems in week 44,
with trafﬁc dropping close to zero. These problems made the news,
and the example highlights how a geographical distant event such
as a hurricane can be discerned from trafﬁc measurements taken at
this geographically distant IXP.

Lastly, we also mention that an IXP is an ideal location to mon-
itor new players such as “resellers”. Resellers are IXP member
ASes, and their main business is to provide and facilitate access
to the IXP for smaller companies that are typically far away geo-
graphically from the IXP. For IXPs, the emergence of resellers is
beneﬁcial as they extend the reach of the IXP into geographically
distant regions and thereby the potential membership base. For ex-
ample, for a particular reseller at our IXP, we observed a doubling
of the server IPs from 50K to 100K in four months, suggesting that
this reseller has been quite successful in attracting new networks
with signiﬁcant server-based infrastructures as its customers.
Summary: When concentrating on the Web server-related portion
of the IXP trafﬁc and performing a longitudinal analysis over a 17-
week long period, we observe signiﬁcant stability – of all the server
IPs for which trafﬁc is observed at the IXP during this 17-week pe-
riod, some 30% are seen at the IXP week-in and week-out and are
responsible for around 60% of all server-related trafﬁc in each and
every week. At the same time, the trafﬁc seen at the IXP does ex-
hibit differences from one week to the next, and we illustrate with
some examples what different types of changes enable us to say
about the network as a whole or some of its individual constituents.
In this sense, the trafﬁc seen at these global Internet vantage points
can be used as complementary source of information for recent ef-

341forts analyzing Internet events such as large-scale outages due to
censorship [32], natural disasters [29], etc.

5. BEYOND THE AS-LEVEL VIEW

To illustrate the beneﬁts and new opportunities for Internet mea-
surements that arise from being able to use our IXP as a vantage
point with very good visibility into the Internet, we describe in
this section an approach for identifying server-based network in-
frastructures and classifying them by ownership. In the process,
we report on a clear trend towards more heterogeneous networks
and network interconnections, provide concrete examples, and dis-
cuss why and how this observed network heterogenization requires
moving beyond the traditional AS-level view of the Internet.
5.1 Alternative grouping of server IPs

To this point, we have followed a very traditional approach for
looking at our IXP data in the sense that we measured the IXP’s
visibility into the Internet in terms of the number of actively routed
ASes or subnets seen at the IXP. However, there exist Internet play-
ers (e. g., CDN77, a recently launched low-cost no-commitment
CDN; Rapidshare, a one-click hosting service; or certain meta-
hosters that utilize multiple hosters) that are not ASes in the sense
that they do not have an assigned ASN. Thus, as far as the tra-
ditional AS-level view of the Internet is concerned, these players
are invisible, and the trafﬁc that they are responsible for goes un-
noticed, or worse misattributed to other Internet players. Yet, be-
ing commercial entities, these companies actively advertise their
services, and in the process often publish the locations and IP ad-
dresses of their servers. This then suggests an alternative approach
to assessing the IXP’s ability to “see” the Internet as a whole—
group servers according to the organization or company that has
the administrative control over the servers and is responsible for
distributing the content. While this approach is easy and works to
perfection for companies like CDN77 that publish all their server
IPs, the question is what to do if the server IPs are not known.

Accordingly, our primary goal is to start with the server IPs seen
at the IXP and cluster them so that the servers in one and the same
cluster are provably under the administrative control of the same or-
ganization or company. To this end, we rely in parts on methods de-
scribed by Plonka et al. [48] for trafﬁc and host proﬁling, Bermudez
et al. [20] for discerning content and services, and Ager et al. [14]
for inferring hosting infrastructures from the content they deliver.
We also take advantage of different sets of meta-data obtained from
assorted active measurement efforts or available by other means as
discussed in Section 2.4. Recall that this meta-data includes for
every server IP seen in the IXP data the corresponding URIs, the
DNS information from active measurements, and, where available,
the list of X.509 certiﬁcates retrieved via active measurements. In
the rest of this section the reported numbers are for week 45.

The clustering proceeds in three steps. First, we focus on those
server IPs for which we have a SOA resource record and consider
a ﬁrst category of clusters that have the property that all server IPs
assigned to a given cluster have the IP and the content managed
by the same authority. We identify those clusters by grouping all
server IPs where the SOA of the hostname and the authority of the
URI lead to the same entry. Prominent organizations that fall into
this ﬁrst category are Amazon and big players like Akamai and
Google when they are located in their own ASes or when they are
in third-party ASes but have assigned names to their own servers.
78.7 % of all our server IPs are clustered in this ﬁrst step.

In a second step, we consider clusters with the property that for
the server IPs in a given cluster, most of the server IPs and most of
the content are managed by the same authority. This can happen

if the SOA is outsourced (e. g., to a third-party DNS provider) and
is common property among hosters and domains served by virtual
servers. In these cases, to group server IPs, we rely on a majority
vote among the SOA resource records, where the majority vote is
by (i) the number of IPs and (ii) the size of the network footprint.
This heuristic enables us to group some server IPs together with
organizations inferred in the previous step and also applies to meta-
hosters such as Hostica. 17.4 % of all our server IPs are clustered in
this second step. Lastly, for the remaining 3.9 % of server IPs that
have been seen in our IXP data and have not yet been clustered, we
only have partial SOA information. This situation is quite common
for parts of the server infrastructure of some large content providers
and CDNs such as Akamai that have servers deployed deep inside
ISPs. In this case, we apply the same heuristic as in the second
step, but only rely on the available subset of information.

To validate our clustering that results from this three-step pro-
cess, we manually compare the results by (1) checking against the
coverage of the public IP ranges that some organizations advertise
(see Section 4.2), (2) utilizing the information of certiﬁcates that
point to applications and services, and (3) actively downloading ei-
ther the front page (e. g., in the case of Google, it is always the
search engine front page) or requested content that is delivered by
a CDN (e. g., in the case of Akamai, any content is delivered by any
of its servers [53]). Our method manages to correctly identify and
group the servers of organizations with a small false-positive rate
of less than 3%. Moreover, we observe that the false-positive rate
decreases with increasing size of the network footprint. However,
there are false-negatives in the sense that our methodology misses
some servers due to the “blind spots” discussed in Section 3.3.

5.2 New reality (I): ASes are heterogeneous

Equipped with an approach for grouping server IPs by organiza-
tions, we examine next to what extent this grouping is orthogonal
to the prevailing AS-level view of the Internet. The issues are suc-
cinctly illustrated in Figure 6(a) where we augment the traditional
AS-level view (i. e., a number of different ASes exchanging trafﬁc
over (public) peering links at an IXP) with new features in the form
of AS-internal details (i. e., the third-party servers that the ASes
host). Note that while the traditional view that makes a tacit ho-
mogeneity assumption by abstracting away any AS-internal details
may have been an adequate model for understanding some aspects
of the Internet and the trafﬁc it carries at some point in the past,
things have changed, and we assert that the cartoon picture in Fig-
ure 6(a) captures more accurately the current Internet reality; that
is, a trend towards distributed network infrastructures that are de-
ployed and operated by today’s commercial Internet players.

To quantify how much closer the cartoon Figure 6(a) is to re-
ality than the traditional AS-level view, we apply our clustering
approach to the 1.5M server IPs seen in our week 45 IXP data and
obtain some 21K clusters, henceforth referred to organizations or
companies. Among them are the well-known big players like Aka-
mai with 28K active server IPs, Google with 11.5K server IPs, and
several large hosters, each with more than 50K server IPs (e. g.,
AS92572 with 90K+ server IPs; AS56740 and AS50099, both with
more than 50K server IPs). Indeed, of the 21K identiﬁed organi-
zations, a total of 143 organizations are associated with more than
1000 server IPs and more than 6K organizations have more than
10 servers IPs. For the latter, Figure 6(b) shows a scatter plot of
the number of server IPs per organization vs. the number of ASes
that they cover. More precisely, every dot in the plot is an orga-
nization, and for a given organization, we show the number of its
server IPs (x-axis) and the number of ASes that host servers from

verse infrastructure is commonplace in today’s Internet and is not
limited to only the Internet’s biggest players, but reporting on the

3While in a few isolated cases, the ASes that host servers from
a given organization are part of that organization (e. g., see [24]),
hand-checking the 143 organizations with more than 1000 servers
conﬁrmed that in almost all cases, these ASes are genuine third-
party networks that are run and operated independently from the
organization whose servers they host.

bewildering array of scenarios we encountered when examining the
extent of the different organizations and the networks they partner
with is beyond the scope of this paper.

The realization that many organizations operate a server infras-
tructure that is spread across many ASes implies that the comple-
mentary view must be equally bewildering in terms of diversity or
heterogeneity. This view is captured in Figure 6(a) by focusing on,
say AS1, and examining how many third-party networks host some
of their servers inside that AS. Thus, yet another way to quantify
how much closer that cartoon ﬁgure is to reality than the traditional
AS-level view with its implicit homogeneity assumption concern-
ing the administrative authority of servers hosted within an AS is
shown in Figure 6(c). Each dot in this ﬁgure represents an AS,
and the number of organizations a given AS hosts is given on the
y-axis while the number of identiﬁed server IPs is shown on the
x-axis. As before, the ﬁgure only shows organizations with more
than 10 servers. We observe that many ASes host a sizable number
of server IPs that belong to many organizations; there are more than
500 ASes that host servers from more than ﬁve organizations, and
more than 200 ASes that support more than 10 organizations.

Indeed, this observation is again fully consistent with public an-
nouncements [1, 6] and content providers’ efforts [5] to install their
own brand of single-purpose CDNs inside various ISPs. The end
effect of such developments is a clear trend towards more hetero-
geneous eyeball ISP networks by virtue of such ASes hosting more
servers from an increasing number of interested third-party net-
works. In view of similar announcements from key companies such
as Google [51, 25, 34], Amazon [2], or Facebook [4], the chal-
lenges of studying, leave alone controlling, such increasingly in-
tertwined networks and trafﬁc are quickly becoming daunting. As
an example, consider a large Web hosting company (AS36351), for
which we identiﬁed more than 40K server IPs belonging to a total
more than 350 different organizations (highlighted in Figure 6(c)
with a square).

5.3 New reality (II): Links are heterogeneous
In Section 5.2, we show that organizations take advantage of net-
work diversity and purposefully spread their infrastructure across
multiple networks. This development creates very ﬂuid and often
transparent network boundaries, which in turn causes havoc when
trying to attribute the right trafﬁc to the right network. The issues
are illustrated in the cartoon Figure 7(a). The ﬁgure shows the tra-
ditional AS-level perspective, whereby Akamai is a member AS
(AS1) of this IXP, and so are a generic AS3 and another generic
(non-Akamai) AS2, and the Akamai AS peers at this IXP with
AS3 which, in turn, peers also with AS2. This traditional AS per-
spective is enriched with member-speciﬁc details that specify that
there is an Akamai server behind/inside (non-Akamai) AS2 and
behind/inside the Akamai AS. Note that in terms of the traditional
AS-level view, the question of how much Akamai trafﬁc is seen at
this IXP is clear-cut and can be simply answered by measuring the
trafﬁc on the peering link between AS3 and the Akamai AS. How-
ever, when accounting for the fact that there is an Akamai server
behind/inside the non-Akamai member AS2, answering that same
question becomes more involved. It requires measuring the traf-
ﬁc on the (Akamai) peering link between AS3 and the Akamai AS
as well as accounting for the Akamai trafﬁc on the (non-Akamai)
peering link between AS3 and (non-Akamai) AS2.

Clearly, for accurately attributing trafﬁc to the responsible par-
ties in today’s network, the trend towards network heterogeniza-
tion creates problems for the traditional AS-level view of the In-
ternet. To illustrate the extent of these problems, we show in Fig-
ure 7(b) what we observe at the IXP for Akamai. Recall that Aka-

Figure 7: AS link heterogeneity: Trafﬁc via direct member link
relative to other member links.

mai (AS20940) is a member of the IXP and peers with some 400
other member ASes. In the traditional view, accounting for Aka-
mai trafﬁc traversing the IXP simply means capturing the trafﬁc
on all the peering links between Akamai and those member ASes.
Unfortunately, this simple view is no longer reﬂecting reality when
Akamai servers are hosted inside or “behind” (non-Akamai) IXP
member ASes. To capture this aspect, Figure 7(b) shows for each
IXP member that peers with Akamai (indicated by a dot) the per-
centage of Akamai trafﬁc on the direct peering link to Akamai
(x-axis) vs. the percentage of total Akamai-server trafﬁc for this
member AS (y-axis). Under the traditional assumption, all dots
would be stacked up at x=100, reﬂecting the fact that to account for
Akamai-related trafﬁc, all that is needed is to measure the Akamai
peering links. However, with Akamai servers being massively de-
ployed in third-party networks, including many of the other mem-

ber ASes of the IXP, we observe that some members get all their
Akamai-related trafﬁc from ASes other than the (member) Akamai
AS (x=0), even when that trafﬁc is sizable (y>>0). Moreover, the
scattering of dots across Figure 7(b) succinctly captures the diverse
spread of trafﬁc across the direct peering link vs. the other member
links. In terms of numbers, Akamai sends 11.1% of its trafﬁc not
via its peering links with the member AS. Put differently, trafﬁc
from more than 15K out of the 28K Akamai servers that we iden-
tiﬁed in our IXP data is seen at the IXP via non-IXP member links
to Akamai. The same holds true for other major CDNs but also for
relatively new players such as CloudFlare. Figure 7(c) shows the
same kind of plot as Figure 7(b) for CloudFlare. It demonstrates
that despite adhering to very different business models (i. e., Aka-
mai deploys servers inside ISPs vs. CloudFlare operates its own
data centers), the two CDNs have similar usage patters as far as
their peering links are concerned.

Looking beyond Akamai, we observe that different services from
the same organization use their servers differently resulting in dif-
ferent usage patterns of the peering links. For example, for Amazon
CloudFront, Amazon’s “CDN part”, almost all trafﬁc is send via
the IXP’s Amazon links. However, for Amazon EC2, the “cloud
part”, a sizable fraction comes via other IXP peering links. We also
noticed that for most cases where we see the use of the non-IXP
member links, the percentage of trafﬁc in those links increases dur-
ing peak times. This may be due to reasons such as load balancing,
performance improvement, or cost savings. Lastly, how our view
of the usage of the IXP’s public peering links is impacted by pri-
vate peerings that may be in place between member ASes of the
IXP remains unexplored.
Summary: To illustrate the kind of beneﬁts that arise from having
access to a global Internet vantage point in the form or our large
European IXP, we conﬁrm a feature of today’s Internet that is well-
known among experts but remains largely under-reported in the net-
working research literature—a tendency of certain Internet players
to either host servers from third-party networks within their own
network infrastructures or deploy their own servers in strategically-
chosen third-party ASes. More importantly, we present a method-
ology for discovering an organization’s servers, whether they are
deployed within the organization’s own AS (or ASes) or inside
some third-party network’s infrastructure, and use it to systemat-
ically assess the extent of this network heterogenization and study
its impact on the usage of peering links at IXPs by these increas-
ingly more heterogeneous member ASes. However, we want to
stress that our AS-links usage-related ﬁndings are not IXP-speciﬁc
(i. e., public peering links), but apply to any AS-link in the Inter-
net, pointing towards serious challenges when trying to attribute
the right trafﬁc to the right party.

6. DISCUSSION AND CAVEATS

We are not the ﬁrst to try and uncover the footprints of the in-
frastructures of commercial Internet players. One group of prior
studies targets speciﬁc Internet companies (e. g., Akamai [54, 39,
52], Youtube [11, 37, 26], Netﬂix [10]), or one click hosters [19]).
Other work is more concerned with inferring Web hosting infras-
tructures by relying on content only [14]. Our approach differs
from these earlier works. For one, we rely on a unique vantage
point in the form of one of the largest European IXPs to supply us
with a weekly pool of some 230M IPs from which we diligently ex-
tract some 1.5M server IPs. Next, we rely exclusively on publicly
available data4 to group these servers by organizations that have

mercial CDN in Section 2.3 is a shortcut. A similar list could also

content. In doing so, we are inspired by earlier studies such as [20,
48]. Lastly, the methodology we develop for grouping servers by
their organization is general in the sense that it applies equally well
to content providers, CDNs, hosting companies, cloud infrastruc-
ture providers, eyeball ASes, or other Internet players.

The difference in perspective between the more traditional AS-
level view of the Internet and our perspective that centers around
organizations and companies and their heterogeneously deployed
server-based infrastructure becomes evident when comparing our
approach to the recent work by Cai et al. [24] on mapping ASes
to organizations. For one, the starting point for [24] is the tradi-
tional AS-level view of the Internet, and two ASes are grouped into
two different organizations if neither of the organizations is a sub-
sidiary of the other (i. e., majority-owned by the other). While such
a top-down ownership-based grouping of ASes captures one aspect
of how ASes are inter-related, it is oblivious to how network infras-
tructures get used and deployed in today’s Internet. In particular,
while the method described in [24] may succeed in clustering all
Akamai-owned ASes under the umbrella organization Akamai, the
publicly known fact that Akamai has more than 100K servers de-
ployed in hundreds of different third-party non-Akamai ASes [46]
cannot be accounted for at all by that approach.

Our work relies critically on the sFlow records provided by one
of the largest IXPs in Europe, and it can be argued that for many
researchers, access to such data cannot be taken for granted. How-
ever, it is important to note that some of these largest IXPs in Eu-
rope generally welcome collaborations with researchers and are
supportive of research efforts that make explicit use of their data
(see for instance [18]). Once access to data collected from such
unique and powerful vantage points is established, the opportuni-
ties for researchers are plentiful.

After presenting evidence for the kind of visibility into the In-
ternet that comes with using one of these largest European IXPs
as a vantage point, we highlight in this paper some of the beneﬁts
that arises from having access to such a vantage point. However,
despite its impressive capabilities, our IXP and the measurements
it collects can only tell us so much about the network’s “state”,
and many important issues remain concerning our knowledge about
what exactly we can and cannot discern about the Internet as whole
and its individual constituents. While we have identiﬁed a number
of “blind spots”, much remains to be done in terms of identifying
and collecting IXP-external information that can be brought to the
table for either checking, validating, or reﬁning the ﬁndings ob-
tained from the use of IXP-internal data only. The question of how
to appropriately fuse selective IXP-external data with IXP-internal
measurements to obtain a picture of the global network and its in-
dividual constituents that is unprecedented in terms of its accuracy,
details, and insight looms as an important open research problem.

7. CONCLUSION

This paper contributes to Internet measurements by reporting on
the existence of single, well-localized physical locations or vantage
points within the Internet infrastructure where one can “see” much
of the global Internet. Mining the data collected at one such vantage
point reveals a network that teems with heterogeneity whichever
way one looks. Given that economic incentives drive many of the
main commercial Internet players to either host third-party servers
in their own network infrastructures or deploy their own servers,
often in massive numbers, in strategically selected (close to the

end users) third-party networks, we expect the observed trend to-
wards increasingly more heterogeneous networks and increasingly
diverse usage of IXP peering links, in particular, and AS-links, in
general, to accelerate, especially in view of the growing importance
of cloud providers. As an interesting consequence of more servers
being deployed close to the end users, we also expect that IXPs in
the future will “see” less end user-to-server trafﬁc but an increasing
amount of server-to-server trafﬁc.

In response to this observed heterogeneity, the paper also con-
tributes to Internet topology research by advancing a new mental
model for the Internet’s ecosystem that accounts for the observed
network heterogenization, points towards measurements that reveal
and keep track of this ongoing heterogenization process, and is rich
and ﬂexible enough to adapt to a constantly changing Internet envi-
ronment. Doing so only scratches the surface of a new and rich
problem space, and our efforts reported in this paper that focus
less on the Internet’s connectivity structure and more on how traf-
ﬁc ﬂows over this connectivity structure are just a ﬁrst step towards
exploring that space.
