Internet = Online Social Networks ? 

  Most visited websites: 

 Facebook (2sd), YouTube (3rd), Twitter (10th) 

  Facebook1: 

 > 800M users 
 > 350M users access through their mobile 
 > 250M photos are uploaded per day 
 > 20M application installation per day 

And privacy ??

Quiz 

Who is this guy ? Who likes his music ? 

Music? Why would that work ? 

8 

  In real life, an individual interest (or lifestyle) might 

reveal many aspects of his personal information 
 demographics or geopolitical aspects. 

  Availability  

 Seemingly harmless ;-) 
 by default settings? 

Not that easy 

9 

  Heterogeneity 

 Too general “I like Jazz Music” 
 Too specific “Angus Young”   

  Difficult to semantically link interests  

 What is the link between  Angus Young, Brian Johnson 

and High Voltage ?  

likes 

10 

  One of the MOST available data 
  Describe users’ tastes 
  Can be used to derive user information 

  Gender, Location, Age, Marital status, Religion, etc. 

✗  Very sparse (millions of likes)   
✗  User-generated (No defined pattern) 
✗  No “standard” granularity 

A toy example 

11 

  Mohammad-Reza Shajarian, Nazeri, Gogosh 
  What does it mean (lack of semantics) 
  What can we infer ? 

Semantics: a naïve example

Extract semantic (Description) 

17 

  ‘Ontologized’ version of wikipedia 

 Using the “structured knowledge” of Wikipedia 

  Extract keywords from a certain  ‘granularity’ 

 Each like is an article  

 Extract Parent Categories of the ‘like’ article 

 Using the same granularity  

Extract semantic (Description) 

  Using the same granularity allows us to semantically 

‘link’ similar concepts 

AC/DC: Australian heavy metal musical groups; Australian hard rock musical 

groups; Blues rock groups; Musical groups established in 1973;  

Angus Young: AC/DC members; Australian blues guitarists; Australian rock 

guitarists; Australian heavy metal guitarists 

High Voltage: AC/DC songs ; Songs written by Angus Young; 1970s rock 

song stubs

LDA as a Probabilistic model 

1. 

Treat data as observations that arise from a 
generative probabilistic process that includes hidden 
variables 
  For documents, the hidden variables reflect the thematic structure 

of the collection. 

2. 

Infer the hidden structure using posterior inference 
  What are the topics that describe this collection? 

3.  Situate new data into the estimated model. 

  How does this new document fit into the estimated topic structure ? 
D.Blei (MLSS’09) 

LDA 

23 

  Words collected into documents 

  Each document is a mixture of a small number of topics  
  Each word's creation is attributable to one of the document's 

topics 

  Topics are not nominative 
  Input:  

  Documents (words Frequency) 
  Number of Topics (K) 

   Output 

  Word distribution per topic 
  Probability for each documents to belong to each topic  

Topic example

Step3

Inferring Hidden Attribute   

27 

  IFV ‘uniquely’ quantifies the interest of each user 

along topics 

  Classify users based on IFV 

 Simple approach 
 Using the nearest neighbors (K-NN)  

  Similar users grouped together. 

 User sharing the ‘same’ taste should share the same 

attributes 

Nearest Friend Neighbor 

28 

  We define an appropriate distance measure in this 

space: chi-squared distance metric 

  Using Kd-tree to reduce the computation from     
to   

Example  

IFV 

Attribute to infer 

user1 

0.2  0.6  0.1 

0.1 

Attribute=? 

user2 

0.3  0.6  0.7 

0.01 

Attribute=? 

user3 

0.2  0.4  0.1 

0.1 

Attribute=Val 

… 

User n 

0.1  0.1  0.1 

0.1 

Attribute=Val 

The n nearest users to user1 are: S={user3, userm, …} 
The attribute is equal the the majority of the attribute in S 
(Majority voting)  

Datasets  

30 

  Public Profiles 

 Crawled more than 400k profiles (Raw-Profiles) 
 More than 100k Latin-written profiles with music 

interests (Pub-Profiles) 

  Private Profiles 

 Using a Facebook App. 
 More than 4000 Private profiles (used 2.5 K, Volunteer-

Profiles) 

Attribute inference 

  We infer the following attributes: 

 Binary 

 Gender {Male, Female} 
 Relationship {Single, Married} 

 Multi-value 

  Country {US,PH,IN,ID,GB,GR,FR,MX,IT,BR } (top10) 
 Age group {13-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 44-54, >54}   

Base-Line Inference  

32 

  Rely on marginal distributions 

 Maximum Likelihood of attributes 

P(u.x = val |U) =

|{v | u.v = val^v ∈ U} |

|U |

  Guess the attributes’ x value from its most likely 

value for all users  
€ 

Inference Accuracy of PubProfiles 

33 

  More than 20% of gain in most cases  

Deeper view: Gender 

34 

  It is clear from the results that music Interests predict 

Female with a high probability 

  May be explained by the number of female 

profiles in our dataset (62%)  

Deeper view: Relationship 

35 

  It is challenging since less than 17% of crawled users disclose 

this attributes  

  Single users are more distinguishable 

o  Single users share on average 9 music Interests whereas married  
share only 5.7 

Deeper view: Country 

36 

  80% of users belong to top 10 countries  
  Country with specific (regional) music have better accuracy  

 we clearly see the role of the semantic   

Accuracy for VolunteerProfile 

37 

  The results are slightly the same as for PubProfile 
  Our method is independent from the source of 

information   

Discussion  ✔ 

38 

  No need for frequent model updates 

  The approach is ‘rather’ General 

  OSN Independent: Many other sources of Information 

(deezer, lastfm, blogs, forums) etc. 

  Use a free, open and updated encyclopedia  

Discussion ✗ 

  Augment the model by analyzing more interest’ 

category 
 Movies 
 Books 
 Sport … 

  Multilanguage Wikipedia to handle foreign 

language 

  More aggressive stemming  

Conclusion 

40 

  Wikipedia Ontology to extract Semantics 
  LDA to extract Topics 

 Socio, demographics, geo political aspects 
 “virtual” Communities 

  K-NN to infer attributes 
  The approach is general 

 Using seemingly harmless information 
 Efficient, inconspicuous profiling 

Crawling Facebook!

43 

  Crawling Facebook was challenging 
  Protection using JavaScript rendering:  
  Using a homemade lightweight browser  

  Protection using a threshold for a maximum number of request 

  Using multiple machines    

  Avoiding Biased Sampling  

  Crawling Facebook public directory (100 millions users) 
  Randomly choose a user and crawl his/her profile 

  Parsing HTML pages 

  It is just a mess
