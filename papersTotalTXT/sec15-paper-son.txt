Abstract
Sensing and actuation systems contain sensors to ob-
serve the environment and actuators to inﬂuence it. How-
ever, these sensors can be tricked by maliciously fabri-
cated physical properties. In this paper, we investigated
whether an adversary could incapacitate drones equipped
with Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) gyro-
scopes using intentional sound noise. While MEMS gy-
roscopes are known to have resonant frequencies that de-
grade their accuracy, it is not known whether this prop-
erty can be exploited maliciously to disrupt the operation
of drones.

We ﬁrst tested 15 kinds of MEMS gyroscopes against
sound noise and discovered the resonant frequencies of
seven MEMS gyroscopes by scanning the frequencies
under 30 kHz using a consumer-grade speaker. The stan-
dard deviation of the resonant output from those gyro-
scopes was dozens of times larger than that of the nor-
mal output. After analyzing a target drone’s ﬂight control
system, we performed real-world experiments and a soft-
ware simulation to verify the effect of the crafted gyro-
scope output. Our real-world experiments showed that in
all 20 trials, one of two target drones equipped with vul-
nerable gyroscopes lost control and crashed shortly after
we started our attack. A few interesting applications and
countermeasures are discussed at the conclusion of this
paper.

Introduction

Sensors are devices that detect physical properties in na-
ture and convert them to quantitative values for actua-
tors and control systems. In many sensing and actuation
systems, actuations are determined on the basis of infor-
mation from sensors. However, these systems can mal-
function because of physical quantities that sensors fail
to measure or measure insensitively. Furthermore, most
sensors cannot distinguish between normal and abnormal

physical properties. Therefore, sensors can measure ma-
licious inputs that are intentionally crafted by an attacker
in addition to the physical stimuli that the sensors should
detect. Because providing detection capabilities for at-
tacks against sensors increases production costs, most
commercial devices with sensors are not equipped with
any ability to detect or protect against such attacks.

Recently, many sensor-equipped devices, such as
smartphones, wearable healthcare devices, and drones,
have been released to make the devices easier and more
convenient to use. In particular, commercial and open-
source drones have been widely used for aerial photog-
raphy, distribution delivery [2, 3], and private hobbies.
These drones have multiple sensors, such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and barometers. A gyroscope measures
changes in tilt, orientation, and rotation based on angu-
lar momentum. It is thus a core sensor for ﬂight attitude
control and position balancing.

To make the ﬂight control modules of drones small,
lightweight, and inexpensive, Micro-Electro-Mechanical
Systems (MEMS) gyroscopes are used. MEMS gyro-
scopes are designed as Integrated Circuit (IC) packages.
Each design has a unique mechanical structure in the IC
package. Depending on the structure of the MEMS gy-
roscope, resonance occurs as a result of sound noise at
resonant frequencies [37, 38, 39, 49]. This resonance
causes performance degradation of the gyroscope.

The resonant frequencies of MEMS gyroscopes are
usually designed to be higher than the audible frequency
band to prevent malfunctioning of the sensing and ac-
tuation systems. However, in our experiments, we dis-
covered that some MEMS gyroscopes that are popularly
used in commercial drones resonate at audible frequen-
cies as well as ultrasonic frequencies. Our experiments
were designed and conducted to analyze how drones are
affected by this phenomenon from an adversary point of
view. The ﬂight control software of our target drone was
also analyzed to examine the propagation of this phe-
nomenon through the whole system. The results of our

real-world experiments and a software simulation show
that this phenomenon could be exploited to launch inca-
pacitating attacks against commercial drones.

The contributions of this research to the ﬁeld can be

summarized as follows:

• We found, using a consumer-grade speaker, that the
resonant frequencies of several popular MEMS gy-
roscopes are not only in the ultrasonic frequency
band but also in the audible frequency band, and we
analyzed their resonant output.

• We investigated the effect of the resonant output of
MEMS gyroscopes on the ﬂight control of drones
via software analysis and simulations.

• We developed a novel approach to attacking drones
equipped with vulnerable MEMS gyroscopes us-
ing intentional sound noise, and we demonstrated
the consequences of our attack in real-world exper-
iments 1

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines
security research to date on sensor systems. Section 3
provides background information on drone systems and
MEMS gyroscopes. Section 4 describes the analyses and
experiments conducted in this study to investigate the ef-
fects of sound noise on MEMS gyroscopes. Analysis of
the ﬂight control software, real-world experiments, and
simulations for attacking drones are described in Sec-
tion 5. A discussion of the results and conclusion drawn
from the results are presented in Sections 6 and 7, re-
spectively.

2 Related Work

The security of sensors recently started to draw atten-
tion with the introduction of consumer-grade sensing and
actuation systems. As this study was focused on input
spooﬁng attacks on gyroscopes, we review in this section
previous researches on 1) privacy issues related to gyro-
scopes, 2) resonant frequencies of gyroscopes, 3) secu-
rity analyses of commercial drones, and 4) input spooﬁng
attacks on sensing circuitry.
Privacy Issues Related to Gyroscopes: Embedded de-
vices can be used to record the private information of
users without their recognition. Because a gyroscope can
be used to measure changes in tilt, orientation, and rota-
tion, it can be used to steal a smartphone user’s keystroke
information, such as unlock passwords, banking pass-
words, and credit card numbers [36, 47]. By exploiting

the capability of the gyroscopes of smartphones to mea-
sure acoustic vibrations at a low frequency band, a new
attack was proposed to eavesdrop speech [59]. The fo-
cus of these studies differed from that of this paper in
that they examined the use of gyroscopes to extract pri-
vate information, without affecting actuation.
Resonant Frequencies of Gyroscopes: Resonant fre-
quency has been identiﬁed as a problem that causes
the performance degradation of MEMS gyroscopes. In
general, the vibrating structures of MEMS gyroscopes
have resonant frequencies. Resonance can occur as a
result of sound noise [37, 38, 39]. Some mechanisms
for mitigating interference from sound have been pro-
posed. Roth suggested a simple and cheap defense
technique that involves surrounding the gyroscope with
foam [49]. Soobramaney proposed the use of an ad-
ditional structure in a gyroscope that responds only to
the resonant frequency to cancel out the resonant output
from the gyroscope [52]. Using an additional feedback
capacitor connected to the sensing electrode, the reso-
nant frequency and the magnitude of the resonance ef-
fect can be tuned [35, 43].
It is widely believed that
most consumer-grade MEMS gyroscopes have resonant
frequencies. However, these resonant frequencies are of-
ten considered to be commercial secrets or are designed
to be just higher than the audible frequency range.
Security Analysis of Commercial Drones: There were
a couple of works on hacking commercial drones. Sam-
land et. al. showed that AR.Drone [5] was vulnerable
to network attacks due to unencrypted Wireless LAN
(WLAN) communication and the lack of authentication
for Telnet and FTP [50]. Kamkar showed that a drone
can be hijacked by another drone using similar vulnera-
bilities [44]. Attacks such as these are focused on hijack-
ing network connections or system privileges.
Input Spooﬁng Attacks on Sensing Circuitry: All
sensing and actuation systems have sensing circuitry that
is composed of the sensor itself and a wire that connects
the sensor to other components of the system. Kune et.
al. showed that an adversary can inject an Electro Mag-
netic Interference (EMI) signal into the wire connect-
ing an analog sensor and Analog-to-Digital Converter
(ADC) to fake a sensing signal [45]. By injecting fake
waveforms, the researchers were able to inhibit pacing
or induce deﬁbrillation shocks in Cardiac Implantable
Electrical Devices (CIEDs). Without affecting the sen-
sor itself, they were able to spoof the sensing signal by
injecting an EMI signal into the sensing circuitry.

It is also possible to affect the sensor itself. For exam-
ple, biometric imaging sensors have frequently been tar-
geted in sensor spooﬁng attacks. Tsutomu et al. showed
that a veriﬁcation rate of more than 68 % could be
achieved against 11 different ﬁngerprint systems using
artiﬁcial ﬁngers [46]. Galbally et al.

rate of the sound source to 96 kHz rather than 48 kHz to
remove aliasing of the generating sound signal.

Another important property of a sound source is To-
tal Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (THD+N), which is
the ratio of the power of the harmonics and noise com-
ponents to that of a fundamental component, expressed
as a percentage. Every speaker has a nonlinear charac-
teristic to its frequency response. This nonlinearity leads
to harmonic distortions and noise of output sound at fre-
quencies that are different from a fundamental frequency.
If the power of these harmonics and noise is high (i.e.,
high THD+N), it is hard to regard the identiﬁed response
as the effect from a single frequency. However, it is not
necessary for low THD+N of the sound source to attack.

quency bands, the SPL values were above 80 dB and the
THD+N values were less than 2 %. Because the sound
source we used was a tweeter that is usually used for
high-frequency sound, the performance was not good in
the low-frequency region (below 1 kHz). It is usually dif-
ﬁcult to hear sound noise at frequencies above approxi-
mately 15 kHz, although we set the maximum volume at
those frequencies. The measured SPL in our experiment
was equivalent to the noise level (around 90 dB SPL) of
a hand drill, hair dryer, heavy city trafﬁc, noisy factory,
and subway in the real world.

scopes were collected for use in this analysis. The tar-

• D is proportional to the changes (deltasum) between
the previous and present output values of the gyro-
scope (line 13).

These three terms directly affect the PID control val-
ues (PIDCtrl[axis]) for each axis (line 14). If the values
of P and D are abnormally large, the PID control val-
ues will also increase abnormally. The desired throttle
control (txCtrl[throttle]) can thus be ignored (line 18).
In the end, all rotor control values are constrained by
the pre-deﬁned minimum and maximum values (line 20).
Throughout the process, the raw data from the gyroscope
were not checked, ﬁltered, or veriﬁed. In other words,
the target drone system fully trusted the integrity of the
gyroscope output in its sensing and actuation. Therefore,
the control of the target drone could be directly affected
by our attack.

We also analyzed the ﬂight control software of

ArduPilot [7] for target drone B. A manual software anal-
ysis shows that the PID algorithm used in ArduPilot is
essentially the same as that used with target drone A.
The only difference between two algorithms is in slight
changes of the gains that are multiplied to each of the P,
I, and D terms. This can be considered a discrepancy in
the conﬁguration values of the sensors.

5.3 Real-World Experiment
While the software analysis described in the previ-
ous section led us to believe that the PIDCtrl[axis]
values would ﬂuctuate when the gyroscope outputs
ﬂuctuated,
this information was not sufﬁcient to an-
swer the following questions: 1) Given user inputs
txCtrl[throttle] and ﬂuctuating PIDCtrl[axis], how much
does rotorCtrl[rotor] change? 2) How does a change in
rotorCtrl[rotor] affect the behavior of the drone? To an-
swer these questions, we decided to launch our attack in
the real world with sound noise causing the ﬂuctuation.
Attack Setup: In this experiment, we attached a small
Bluetooth speaker above the target system’s gyroscope at
a distance of 10 cm to serve as an attacking sound source.
The SPL of the fundamental frequency component was
113 dB with the maximum volume of the speaker. Low
THD+N was not a consideration for the sound source
used in the attack. The sound noise was turned on while
the target drones were stably maintained in the air. To
observe the status of the target drones before, during, and
after the attack, sound noise at the resonant frequency
was turned off, turned on (attack), and turned off again
for every 10 seconds.
Attack Results: The results of our attack experiment are
summarized on two target drones (A and B) in Table 4.
Our attacks successfully disrupted control of target drone
A, but it did not affect target drone B. The reason of at-
tack failure on target drone B is that the gyroscope of
target drone B resonated only along the Z-axis. The Z-
axis of target drone B corresponds to the horizontal ori-
entation that is also sensed by the magnetometer on the
board.

We also attached a sonar device to gauge the altitude

target drone A on a desk. Figure 11 shows the rela-
tive standard deviation of the gyroscope output measured
at a 10 cm distance, which decreases logarithmically as
the sound level decreases. Theoretically, the relation-
ship between the sound amplitude and SPL is described
by Equation 1 [27]. At the point of the reference SPL
(SPLre f ), the amplitude of the sound noise signal is Are f .

Are f(cid:30)
SPL = SPLre f + 20log(cid:31) A

(1)

The relative SPL obtained by changing the amplitude
is the second term in Equation 1, and it is illustrated in
Figure 11, along with the measured relative standard de-
viations. The decreasing trend in our measurements is
similar to that for the theoretical relative SPLs, but the
amount of decrease in our measurements was smaller
than that for the theoretical relative SPLs from the am-
plitude range over 70 %. This mismatch is the typical
output characteristic of consumer-grade speakers at high
amplitude levels, which is caused by the nonlinear dis-
tortion that also leads to the leakage of sound energy into
harmonic and subharmonic frequencies.
Distance Analysis: The amplitude of the sound noise
corresponding to 37 % (-8.64 dB) of the standard devi-
ation in Figure 11 is approximately 27 %, because the
standard deviation of the gyroscope output is propor-
tional to the scale of the gyroscope output. Accordingly,
the sound noise greater than 27 % in amplitude can in-
duce the maximum changes in all rotor controls for target
drone A, if the drone is tested at the same environment
as that of our real-world attack.

In the real-world experiments, we changed the ampli-
tude of the sound noise in the same environment and ob-
served that around 30 % sound amplitude is the lower
bound for making target drone A crash. The SPL mea-
sured at this 30 % sound amplitude was 108.5 dB. Us-
ing the following relationship between the distance and
SPL [58], we can derive a possible attack distance of a
remotely located sound source, where the reference dis-
tance (dre f ) and SPL (SPLre f ) are those measured from
the real-world attack experiments.

SPL = SPLre f − 20log(cid:31) d
dre f(cid:30)

(2)

According to this prediction, the possible attack dis-
tance is approximately 16.78 cm using the same sound
source that we used for the real-world attack with the
maximum volume (113 dB). This attack distance range
might not be sufﬁcient for a malicious attacker. How-
ever, attackers can overcome this distance limitation by
using a more powerful and directional source (e.g., a
loudspeaker array) than the single speaker used in our
experiments. For instance, SB-3F [23] from Meyersound

can generate sound of 120 dB at 100 m, and 450XL [21]
from LRAD and HyperShield [33] from UltraElectronics
can produce 140 dB at 1 m, which is equivalent to 108.5
dB at 37.58 m. Therefore, the possible attack distance
is 37.58 m, if an attacker uses a sound source that can
generate 140 dB of SPL at 1 m.

6 Discussion

In this section, we present a discussion of potential attack
scenarios and countermeasures.

6.1 Potential Attack Scenarios
The attack model used in this paper seems to be too
strong in two ways: 1) Use of audible sound can be easily
detected, and 2) the speaker is close to the drone body.
However, the more practical attack can be designed to
weaken this attack model from the analysis result of this
study.

First, several gyroscopes listed in Table 1 have res-
onant frequencies in the inaudible band (i.e., above 20
kHz). If the resonant frequency is above 20 kHz, a suc-
cessful attack is possible using an ultrasonic sound gen-
erator and transducer. In addition, sound at frequencies
higher than 15 kHz is difﬁcult for humans to hear.

Second, the distance analysis shows that various re-
mote attacks are also possible using different types of
sound generators. Some of promising ways for the re-
mote attack are described below.
Compromising the Sound Source:
It is not hard to
imagine drones with speakers (consider police and mil-
itary operations or search-and-rescue operations).
If
one can compromise the source of the sound from the
speaker, the effect will be the same as that of our origi-
nal attack model. For example, insecurity of the Hybrid
Broadcast-Broadband Television (HbbTV) standard and
implementation would allow an adversary to control the
TV stream [48].
Drone to Drone Attack: In 2013, Kamkar demonstrated
the ‘SkyJack’ attack, in which an adversary drone hi-
jacks a victim drone using a wireless denial-of-service
attack [44]. A similar attack could involve following
and taking a picture of a moving object, which could be-
come a popular drone application. An adversary drone
equipped with a speaker could steer itself toward a victim
drone and generate a sound with the resonant frequency
of the victim’s gyroscope to drag it down. Of course, in
this case, the resonant frequency of the adversary’s gyro-
scope has to be different from that of the victim.
Long Range Acoustic Device: Long Range Acous-
tic Device (LRAD) [56] could be used as a sonic
weapon [57] or Acoustic Hailing Device (AHD) [54].
Sonic weapons can cause damages to human organs

and a simulation of the ﬂight control software output,
the control signals of four rotors were found to ﬂuctu-
ate up to the maximum value and down to the minimum
value by the injected gyroscope output. One of the target
drones, which was equipped with with a small speaker,
lost control and crashed in all 20 real-world attack exper-
iments. We found in these experiments that an attacker
with only 30% of the amplitude of the maximum sound
noise could achieve almost the same effect at the same
distance.

The countermeasures that are mentioned in the last
subsection have limitations and require hardware modi-
ﬁcations and additional materials. Because these mitiga-
tions would increase the production costs, it is necessary
to develop a low-cost, software-based defense mecha-
nism against sensor attacks for various types of embed-
ded devices.

Some MEMS gyroscopes are integrated with ac-
celerometers in the same IC package.
In our experi-
ments, we found that some accelerometers are also af-

It would be interesting to further investigate this ﬁnding.
