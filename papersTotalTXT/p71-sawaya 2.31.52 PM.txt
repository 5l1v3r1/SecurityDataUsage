ABSTRACT 
There are many anti-spam techniques available today. However, 
spammers evolve mass mailing techniques in order to circumvent 
these  countermeasures.  One  example  of  such  evolutionally 
advanced  spammers  is  observed  in  email  services  offered  by 
Japanese mobile phone service providers. Because they have been 
enforcing  very  strict  anti-spam  filters,  commonly  used  mass 
mailing  techniques  such  as  spam  botnets  are  becoming  less 
effective,  and  spammers  thus  have  to  evolve  their  technologies.  
In order to understand such evolutionally advanced spam-sending 
hosts' behaviors, we collected and analyzed their traffic flow data 
retrieved at a backbone network in the real commercial network 
of  one  of  the  largest  mobile  phone  service  providers  in  Japan, 
which has over 30 million customers.  In this paper, we first show 
that many of the existing  anti-spam  techniques  are  not  effective 
against advanced spammers, and then reveal that such advanced 
spammers  have  distinctive  time-series  behavioral  characteristics 
that  have  the  potential  to  be  exploited  in  developing  new 
mitigation techniques and predicting their behavior in the future.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Email service is widely used by Internet users. Typically in Japan, 
mobile  phone  service  providers  offer  email  services  and  people 
usually use mobile phone email (which we call "MPE") services 
on their feature phones or smart phones rather than email services 
offered by third-party providers such as Gmail [1] or Hotmail [2]. 
MPE service providers offer spam filters similarly to third-party

that  have 

the  potential 

to  be  exploited 

email  services.  A  difference  between  them  is  that  spam  filters 
offered by MPE services have the strict option of dropping such 
email  messages  whose  email  addresses  are  spoofed,  listed  in 
blacklists  defined  by  users,  and  so  on.  Moreover,  the  Japanese 
government  has  suggested  that  Internet  service  providers  (ISPs) 
should  apply  Outbound  Port  25  Blocking  (OP25B)  [3],  which 
blocks access to port 25 from dynamic IP addresses on their own 
networks.  As  a  result,  commonly  used  mass  mailing  techniques 
such as spam botnets become less effective, and spammers have 
thus been evolving techniques in order to pass such filters. 
In order to understand such evolutionally advanced spam-sending 
hosts' behaviors, we collected and analyzed their traffic flow data 
retrieved at a backbone network in the real commercial network 
of  one  of  the  largest  mobile  phone  service  providers  in  Japan, 
which has over 30 million customers.  In this paper, we first show 
that many existing anti-spam techniques are not effective against 
evolutionally  advanced  spammers,  and  then  reveal  that  such 
advanced  spammers  have  distinctive 
time-series  behavioral 
characteristics 
in 
developing  new  mitigation  techniques  and  predicting  their 
behavior  in  the  future.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  neither 
analysis  of  such  evolutionally  advanced  spammers  nor  a  time 
series of their behaviors has been studied before. 
In  order  to  perform  time-series  behavioral  analysis,  we  first 
collect  spam  messages  received  by  accounts  that  never  receive 
legitimate messages. We then collect a time series of the sending 
patterns of each spam-sending host from the backbone routers for 
one  week  to  extract  their  entire  spamming  activities  at  MPE 
service and to categorize these patterns into arbitrary clusters by 
an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, i.e., X-means [4]. 
According  to  our  analysis,  we  observed  typical  behaviors  of 
evolutionally advanced spammers: (1) sending spam at a specific 
time period and then stopping sending, (2) periodically repeatedly 
sending  spam  messages  and  then  stopping  spamming  at  some 
specific 
in  a  day,  and  (3)  sending  spam  messages 
continuously. We also found that some spammers used different 
organizations to send spam messages and that some organizations 
played  the  role  of  spam-sending  agent.  Moreover,  we  revealed 
that many spam-sending hosts do not change their behavior even 
in  the  future.  From  these  results,  analyzing  the  time-series 
behaviors  of  spam-sending  hosts  can  be  an  important  part  of 
predicting  the  future  behaviors  of  spammers  as  well  as  the 
relationships among them. 
This approach will be a countermeasure detecting not only MPE 
spam-sending hosts but also spam messages if spammers targeting 
non-MPE  services  change  their  strategies  when  the  current 
detection techniques are widely and strictly used in the future.

2.1  Spam Mitigation Techniques 
A huge number of spam detection and mitigation techniques have 
been  proposed.  Among  them,  the  following  spam  detection  and 
mitigation  techniques  are  widely  used  at  enterprise  networks  or 
ISP networks. 
2.1.1  OP25B 
OP25B is an anti-spam ISP measure by which the ISP checks the 
IP address and the port number of all accesses through its routers 
and  blocks  access  to  port  25  from  dynamic  IP  addresses  on  its 
network. Access to port 25 on an ISP's mail server from the static 
IP address of their customers is allowed, while access to port 25 
from  the  dynamic  IP  address  of  their  customers  is  blocked.  By 
using this method, spam messages sent from the customers of the 
ISP controlled by botnet is blocked and as a result, the outgoing 
spam mail from the ISP is blocked. This method is quite efficient 
if  all  the  ISPs  apply  it,  but  incoming  spam  mails  cannot  be 
blocked. 
Typically in Japan, the government suggested that ISPs use  this 
technique  and  as  a  result,  the  spam  mails  sent  from  botnet-
controlled hosts in Japan have decreased, but spam messages from 
ISPs that do not apply this technique or spam messages sent from 
Japanese static IP addresses are still transmitted. 
2.1.2  Content filters  
Content filters are widely used at enterprise email servers. One of 
these techniques, SpamAssassin [5], is a program released under 
the  Apache  License  2.0  used  for  email  spam  filtering  based  on 
content-matching rules. SpamAssassin also uses a variety of spam 
detection  techniques,  which  includes  DNS-based  and  fuzzy-
checksum-based  spam  detection,  Bayesian  filtering,  external 
programs,  blacklists,  and  online  databases.  It  is  used  widely  in 
personal usage as well as enterprise usage. 
2.1.3  SPF/Sender-ID 
Spammers often spoof their own mail addresses to hide their real 
identities.  The  Sender  Policy  Framework  (SPF)  [6]  is  an  email 
validation  system  designed  to  prevent  email  spam  by  detecting 
email  address  spoofing,  a  common  vulnerability,  by  verifying 
sender IP addresses. SPF allows administrators to specify which 
hosts are allowed to send mail from a given domain by creating a 
specific SPF record (or text record) in DNS. Mail exchangers use 
the DNS to check that mail from a given domain is being sent by 
a host sanctioned by that domain's administrators. Sender-ID [7] 
is a technique similar to SPF. SPF verifies the email addresses of 
the  mail-from  header  in  the  SMTP  envelope,  while  Sender-ID 
verifies the email address in the email header instead. 
2.1.4  DNSBL 
DNSBL such as [8, 9] is a common approach to detect spam mail 
by determining spam-sending hosts. DNSBLs, which are provided 
by  international  nonprofit  organizations  or  security  product 
companies,  operate  a  list  of  spam  senders'  IP  addresses,  and 
SMTP servers block mail according to this list. DNSBL is often 
used  as  indicator  of  spam  messages  by  content  filters  such  as 
SpamAssassin. Although this method is efficient for well-known 
spam-sending hosts, it is not efficient for unknown or new spam-
sending hosts. 
2.1.5  S25R 
S25R [10] is a method whereby SMTP servers determine whether 
the SMTP client seems to be an end-user of the ISP network. This 

method  is  based  on  the  fact  that  spammers  send  spam  mail 
directly  from  end-users'  computers,  which  are  infected  by  bots, 
while  legitimate  mail  senders  use  the  mail  servers  that  are 
operated by the ISPs. They use the character string features of the 
hostname  obtained  by  querying  the  DNS  reverse  lookup  of  IP 
addresses. For example, if the hostnames of SMTP clients include 
"dhcp,"  "dialup,"  or  "ppp,"  or  have  a  lot  of  numbers,  which  are 
often  seen  in  end-host  names,  they  are  determined  to  be  spam-
sending clients. It also determines clients that have no hostname 
to be spam senders.  
As many false positives occur by using this method, it is usually 
used with the other techniques. 
2.2  Spammer Analysis 
There are several reports on spammer behavior analysis. Husna et 
al.  showed  that  the  relationship  among  spammers  demonstrates 
highly  clustering  structures  based  on  features  such  as  content 
length,  time  of  arrival,  frequency  of  email,  active  time,  inter-
arrival  time,  and  content  type  [11].  They  performed  Principal 
Component  Analysis  (PCA)  on  a  feature  set  to  identify  the 
features  that  account  for  the  maximum  variance  in  spamming 
patterns. Further, they calculated the proximity between different 
spammers  and  classified  them  into  various  groups  and  showed 
that  each  group  represented  similar  proximity.  For  classification 
into  botnet  groups,  they  used  clustering  algorithms  such  as 
Hierarchical and K-means. They identify botnet spammers into a 
particular group with a precision of 90%.  
Tang  et  al.  built  such  systems  that  extracted  email  senders' 
behavior data based on global sending distribution, analyzed them, 
and  assigned  a  value  of  trust  to  each  IP  address  sending  email 
messages [12]. They analyzed the performance of two commonly 
used  data-mining  techniques:  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM) 
and  Random  Forests  (RF).  Inputs  to  both  models  are  sending 
behavior  collected  from  sensors  in  real  time.  These  systems 
returned  IP  addresses'  reputation  scores  as  outputs,  and  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of classification modeling were then 
empirically analyzed.  
Revealing  spam-sending  patterns  by  using  features  such  as  the 
traffic volume, frequency, and time is reported as described above 
and some studies are detecting automated activities in other areas 
(e.g., [13]).  But neither analysis of time-series sending patterns of 
spam nor analysis of  such  evolutionally  advanced  spam-sending 
hosts has yet been reported.  
3.  ANALYSIS OF MPE SPAM  
In  this  section,  we  describe  the  differences  between  MPE 
messages  and  other  non-MPE  email  messages, 
i.e.,  spam 
messages targeting non-mobile ISPs. We then apply the previous 
spam detection techniques to evaluate whether they are effective 
in detecting MPE spam messages. 
3.1  Country Statistics of MPE Spam 
We  describe  the  difference  in  country  distribution  of  spam 
messages  between  MPE  spam  and  non-MPE  spam.  A  total  of 
30,839  spam  messages  were  retrieved  at  18  Japanese  MPE 
accounts from March 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012.  
Figure 1 shows the country distribution of hosts sending spam to 
MPE  services.  We  used  the  mapping  table  of  IP  addresses  and 
countries provided by [14]. According to reference [15], the top 
three  countries  sending  spam  messages  to  both  MPE  and  non-
MPE accounts in Japan are China, the United States, and Japan, 
while  Japan,  the  United  States,  and  the  Philippines  are  listed  as 

72terms 

including  friendly 

the top three countries sending spam messages to MPE accounts. 
This  difference  indicates  that  Filipino  providers  are  used  quite 
frequently  for  sending  spam  messages  to  MPE  accounts.  Over 
50% of spam messages were sent from Japanese hosts, i.e., almost 
all of them were not bot-controlled hosts (see Section 2.1.1). 
3.2  Evaluation of Existing Methods 
We  evaluated  whether  the  previous  techniques  are  efficient  in 
detecting MPE spams as well as non-MPE spams. We tested four 
techniques: content filter, SPF, DNSBL, and S25R. 
3.2.1  Content filter 
We  evaluated  customized  SpamAssassin,  which  detects  spam 
messages  written  in  Japanese  as  well  as  in  English.  This  filter 
detected  all  of  the  spam  messages  received  at  one  non-MPE 
account  (zero  false  negatives)  with  a  few  false  positives  (0.4%) 
during  the  period  from  August  1,  2011  to  June  6,  2012.  We 
applied this filter to 1,417 spam messages received at one MPE 
account from May 17 to May 21, 2012. The results showed that 
836 false negative spam messages were observed. We found that 
almost all of these messages were about online social networking 
services 
to  mimic  acquaintances. 
Although these MPE spam messages were written in Japanese as 
were the non-MPE spam messages, this filter did not work well. 
Therefore, the contents of MPE spam messages are quite different 
from  those  received  at  non-MPE  accounts  and  are  rarely 
identified as spam by content filters.  
3.2.2  SPF 
We  applied  SPF  to  35,383  spam  messages  retrieved  at  18  MPE 
accounts from March 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012. Figure 2 shows 
the  distribution  of  SPF  authentication  results.  Over  50%  were 
determined  as  "Pass."  This  means  that  they  did  not  spoof  their 
source  email  addresses  and  registered  SPF  records  to  mimic  a 
legitimate  sender.  On  the  other  hand,  the  non-MPE  spam 
messages discussed in Section 3.2.1 did not contain such "Pass" 
messages.  From  these  results,  SPF  is  less  useful  for  MPE  spam 
messages. 
3.2.3  DNSBL 
We  evaluated  two  DNSBLs  of  IP  addresses  in  the  35,383 
messages  retrieved  at  18  MPE  accounts  from  March  1,  2011  to 
March  31,  2012.  Spamhaus  Zen  [8]  DNSBL  detected  50.0%  of 
spam  messages,  whereas  Barracuda  Central  [9]  detected  only 
17.8% of them. The result of Zen DNSBL was lower than 85.0%, 
which is the rate reported in the whitepaper of Spamhaus [16] for 
non-MPE  messages.  This  result  shows  that  MPE  spammers  are 
either  using  clean  IP  addresses  that  have  never  been  used  for 
sending  spam  before  or  narrowing  down  their  target  to  specific 
email  accounts.  For  these  reasons,  DNSBL  does  not  show  high 
performance for MPE spam messages.  
3.2.4  S25R 
We  performed  S25R  techniques  for  35,383  spam  messages 
retrieved at 18 MPE accounts from March 1, 2011 to March 31, 
2012.  
S25R  detected  only  71.4%  of  all  spam-sending  hosts.  From  a 
report  of  S25R  sites,  it  detected  98.5%  of  non-MPE  spam 
messages  with  many  false  positives  [10].  As  we  mentioned 
before,  many  MPE  spam  messages  do  not  come  from  botnet-
controlled hosts, so it is difficult to identify MPE spam messages 
by S25R, which focuses on detecting botnet-controlled hosts.

4.  BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OF MPE 
SPAM 
According to our preliminary evaluation, we found that different 
spam-sending hosts showed similar time-series behavior, even if 
previous techniques such as DNSBL and content filters find such 
behavior difficult to handle. Therefore, we focused on the time-
series spam-sending behaviors of MPE spam-sending hosts. 
4.1  Experimental Environments 
We  describe  the  experimental  conditions.  Figure  3  shows  our 
experimental environment. Two types of logs are collected: MPE 
spam messages and traffic flow data. 
MPE  spam  messages  are  collected  at  18  MPE  accounts  that 
receive  only  spam  messages,  called  decoy  accounts.  These 
accounts receive approximately 1,000 spam messages per day on 
average. 
The  traffic  flow  data  is  collected  with  NetFlow  [17]  and  sFlow 
[18]  at  the  core  routers  in  a  mobile  phone  service  provider's 
network  in  which  MPE  traffic  is  observed.  The  traffic  data 
contains the following information:  
- Source IP addresses 
- Data sizes (packets, bytes) 
- Timestamps 

73Technically,  we  can  collect  raw  traffic  flow  data  at  a  flow 
collector and analyze it directly. However, according to the law of 
the secrecy of communication in Japan [19], hosts related to the 
traffic data should be anonymized before we evaluate the data.  
 
4.2  Sending Pattern of Spammers 
We  analyzed  the  time-series  sending  patterns  in  a  specific  time 
period. The following subsections describe the analysis process in 
detail. 
4.2.1  Extracting behaviors 
For  extracting  behaviors  of  spam-sending  hosts,  we  applied  the 
process as shown in Figure 4. Each behavior is extracted by the 
following four steps. 
(1) First, unique IP addresses during specific time period D from 
time  T,  i.e.,  between  the  time  T  and  T+D,  are  extracted  from 
messages  received  at  decoy  accounts  and  identified  as  known 
spam-sending hosts. 
(2)  Next,  all  the  traffic  flow  data  sent  from  the  known  spam-
sending  hosts  retrieved  between  time  T  and  T+D  are  extracted. 
Not only the traffic destined for decoy accounts but also for other 
MPE  accounts  from  known  spammers  is  extracted.  The  hourly 
behaviors of each host h, xhk, are then extracted from the traffic 
flow data by the following equation as shown in Figure 5.

where k is the hours elapsed from time T (
The behavior vector of each host h during period D, Xh, is defined 
as:  
  Xh = <xh0, xh1, ..., xhD-1>                                                       (2). 
(3)  Then,  the  MPE  spam-sending  hosts'  properties  are  retrieved 
before  anonymization.  DNSBL  query  results,  S25R  results 
verified by DNS reverse lookup, and the organization names for 
the corporation of each host from Whois query are collected. 
(4)  Finally,  the  IP  addresses  and  Whois  information  of  known 
spam-sending  hosts  are  anonymized  while  keeping 
their 
correspondences. The one-way hash function is applied. 
4.2.2  Clustering behaviors 
As  hosts  have  various  kinds  of  behaviors,  we  categorized  the 
MPE  spam-sending  hosts 
the 
clustering technique to understand the behavioral proximities and 
relationships  among  the  spam-sending  hosts.  We  used  the  X-
means  algorithm  for  clustering  spam  behavior  vectors  Xh.  X-
means is extended K-means for estimating the number of clusters, 
and the number of clusters is not necessary. 
4.2.3  Result of clustering 
We  collected  the  spam-sending  hosts  from  decoy  accounts  and 
their traffic flow data. T and D were March 15, 2012 19:00 and 
one week, respectively.  We  collected  2,695  spam-sending  hosts' 
behaviors.  Then  these  spam-sending  hosts  were  clustered  into 
multiple clusters. 
The number of clusters was 31. The entire behaviors are described 
in  Appendix  1,  and  Figure  6  shows  a  typical  example  of  the

characteristic  patterns  of  spam-sending  hosts.  The  clustering 
technique  worked  effectively  since  hosts  in  each  cluster  start 
sending  spam  and  stop  sending  at  similar  timings  and  seem  to 
exhibit similar behaviors, and when we re-run this algorithm for 
the same dataset, we could obtain similar clusters as described in 
Appendix  A.1.  We  found  three  typical  patterns.  The  spam-
sending hosts in Cluster 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 were sending 
spam at a specific time  period and  then  stopped  sending,  which 
we call burst behavior. Cluster 11 and 28 periodically repeated 
sending spam messages and stopped at some specific time in each 
day,  which  we  call  cyclic  behavior.  The  hosts  clustered  into 
Cluster  1,  2,  3,  5,  and  6  were  sending  spam  messages

behaviors  do  not  seem  to  have  specific  characteristics  and  were 
sending randomly or sending at specific intervals in a week. From 

the 

the  other  hand, 

these results, there is a potentiality that the hosts clustered into the 
same cluster use a similar spam-sending program. 
4.2.4  Properties of clusters 
Figure 7 shows the percentage of hosts listed in DNSBL for each 
cluster.  On  the  x-axis,  clusters  whose  behaviors  were  "burst," 
"cyclic," and "continuing" are denoted as prefixes (Î±), (Î²), and (Î³) 
respectively. A relatively small number of hosts in Cluster 3, 5, 6, 
8, 9, 17, 20, 21, 22, and 25 were listed in DNSBL. These clusters 
have  burst,  continuing,  and  other  behaviors,  and  no  cyclic 
behaviors.  On  the  other  hand,  many  hosts  that  had  cyclic 
behaviors (Cluster 11 and 28) were listed in DNSBL at a high rate. 
This  result  seems  to  show  that  the  hosts  whose  behaviors  were 
cyclic  frequently  appeared  and  as  a  result,  they  were  listed  in 
DNSBL. Hosts in some clusters of continuing behaviors such as 
Cluster 5 and 6 were scarcely sending spam messages at time T, 
but  started  sending  spam  messages  in  duration  D.  Since  a 
relatively small number of them were listed in DNSBL, this result 
indicates that they were new spam-sending hosts that had not sent 
spam messages before the time we observed. 
Figure 8 shows the distributions of the top five organizations that 
frequently appeared in 2,695 hosts for each cluster. Over half of 
the hosts in Cluster 5, 9, and 13 were single organizations of the 
top  five.  On 
top  five  spam-sending 
organizations seldom appeared in the other clusters. We examined 
all the distributions of organizations in these clusters. The hosts in 
the other clusters diverged into multiple organizations. This result 
indicates that many spam-sending hosts in different organizations 
or  countries  have  the  same  sending  patterns  and  that  some 
spammers  in  the  background  use  different  organizations  to  send 
spam  messages  and  some  organizations  play  the  role  of  spam-
sending agent.  
Organization A was observed the most in Cluster 13. Almost all 
the  hosts 
in  Cluster  13  sent  and  stopped  sending  spam 
simultaneously. However, this organization was observed at many 
other clusters whose patterns were different. From this result, this 
organization  has  many  different  types  of  spammers  or  one 
spammer changes their behavior. Organization C was observed in 
Cluster 5 at a high rate. Cluster 5 has continuing behavior and a 
small  number  of  the  hosts  were  listed  in  DNSBL.  For  these 
reasons,  Organization  C  is  suspected  of  being  an  organization 
whose IP addresses are not often used for spam-sending activities 
and  at  this  moment,  they  have  started  to  send  many  spam 
messages.  
Figure  9  shows  the  distributions  of  the  top  10  countries  that 
frequently  appeared  in  2,695  hosts  for  each  cluster.  The  small 
number of hosts in Cluster 10 came from the top 10 countries. We 
looked  deeply  at  the  countries  of  these  hosts  in  this  cluster  and 
found that 21 countries were observed. Since they send and stop 
sending  spam  messages  at  same  time,  and  the  organizations  in 
Cluster 10 were multiple as mentioned before, we observed that 
spammers  in  the  background  are  sending  spam  messages  using 
multiple organizations in different countries.  
4.2.5  Behaviors of the next one week 
We tracked the next one-week behavior for each cluster by Step 
(2), Section 4.2.1. The entire behaviors are described in Appendix 
A.2, and Figure 10 shows a typical example of the results. A total 
of 16 of 31 clusters (Cluster 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 20, 
22, 28, 30, and 31) did not change their behavior. Cluster 5 and 6, 
i.e.,  continuing  behavior,  also  kept  sending  spam  messages. 
Neither  did  the  cyclic  behavior  change  even  in  the  next  week.

Figure 9. Ratio of spammers' locations of each cluster. 

Cluster 19, 20, and 22, and a portion of Cluster 17, 21, and 23 did 
not change their burst behaviors even in the next week. Cluster 1, 
30,  and  31  were  the  biggest  three  clusters  and  also  continued 
similar behaviors as in the previous one week.

5.  DISCUSSION 
According to the result of Section 3, we showed that MPE spam 
messages are quite different from  non-MPE  spam  messages  and 
that  the  previous  techniques  are  not  effective.  However,  in 
Section  4,  we  found  three  typical  spam-sending  activities  and 
discovered that they maintained similar behaviors into the future.  
5.1  Behaviors over a Longer Duration 
We analyzed the clusters that did not have these three behaviors 
in  detail.  Cluster  16,  whose  behavior  did  not  fit  into  our  three 
categories,  was  stopping  sending  messages  gradually.  We 
examined  these  behaviors  in  the  next  week  and  found  that  they 
scarcely sent spam messages in the next week. From this result, 
though  we  did  not  see  any  clear  patterns  of  the  spam-sending 
hosts,  we  can  predict  their  future  behaviors  by  observing  the 
tendencies of the past. We also analyzed the behaviors of Cluster 
7 and 26 for the next four weeks in order to see whether they have 
periodicity or a clear tendency over a longer duration. Figure 11 
shows their behaviors. In four weeks, the hosts in Cluster 7 sent 
messages  and  stopped  concurrently  after  the  first  week  and 
gradually  stopped  during  the  next  week,  and  finally,  they  sent

messages  randomly.  The  hosts  in  Cluster  26  repeated  burst 
behavior multiple times, which shows that they behave cyclically 
with  an  eight-day  cycle.  From  these  results,  if  we  employ  our 
clustering  technique  for  the  longer  term,  we  will  be  able  to 
discover  the  tendency  and  periodicity  of  hosts  that  cannot  be 
observed in a shorter period of time. 
5.2  Behavior Comparison with other 
Messages 
In order to evaluate whether the three behaviors shown in Section 
4 are unique to evolutionally advanced spam-sending hosts or not, 
we applied our clustering technique to 13,221 spam-sending hosts 
targeting  non-MPE  accounts  retrieved  at  our  enterprise  network 
from  May  17,  2012  19:00  to  May  24,  2012  18:59.  Only  two 
clusters  were  created:  one  was  a  cluster  of  continuing  behavior 
(similar to Cluster 1 in Appendix A.1) and the other was random 
sending  hosts  cluster  (similar  to  Cluster  30  and  31  in  Appendix 
A.1). We also evaluated it for 1,186 legitimate hosts for non-MPE 
accounts.  Three  clusters  were  created  and  all  of  them  were 
random behaviors similar to Cluster 30 in Appendix  A.1.  These 
results  indicate  that  the  three  behaviors  were  unique  to  MPE 
spam-sending  hosts.  This  seems  to  result  from  the  fact  that 
evolutionally  advanced  spam-sending  hosts  deliberate 
their 
sending methods so as to send spam messages efficiently using a 
spam-sending program. For this reason, since these three sending 
patterns  are  unique  to  spam-sending  hosts,  we  will  be  able  to 
detect  such  evolutionally  advanced  spam-sending  hosts  by  their 
behaviors. Although we dealt with the behaviors of MPE spam-
sending hosts in Japan in this paper, such behavioral differences 
could  be  observed  even  if  we  are  dealing  with  evolutionally 
advanced non-MPE hosts.  
5.3  Other Usage of Decoy Accounts 
We discuss another usage of the data collected in decoy accounts. 
Half  the  spam  messages  received  at  decoy  accounts  were  not 
listed  in  DNSBLs.  This  indicates  that  there  is  a  possibility  of 
creating an efficient blacklist of spam-sending hosts using decoy 
accounts.  We  calculated  the  traffic  volume  of  2,695  hosts  from 
decoy accounts during the period from March 15, 2012 to March 
22, 2012. The traffic volume was 3.7 TB/week, i.e., 6.1 MB/sec. 
According to a mobile phone service provider [20], the size of one 
email message is approximately 11.3 KB including the header and 
message body. Therefore, our technique detected spam messages 
corresponding to 47 million email messages per day by collecting 
the hosts sending spam messages to decoy accounts. 

this  paper,  we  revealed 

6.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In 
the  spam-sending  patterns  of 
evolutionally  advanced  spammers  such  as  Japanese  MPE 
spammers by using the traffic flow data retrieved at a backbone 
network in a real commercial network.  
We showed that our technique can estimate typical evolutionally 
advanced spam-sending hosts because some of their behaviors are 
unique  to  MPE  spam-sending  hosts.  Also,  we  can  predict  the 
behavior  of  the  spam-sending  hosts  by  checking  their  past 
behaviors. By using this technique, if we see a host that is likely 
to send spam messages at some point in time, we can predict the 
timing of spam-sending activities in the future.  
We  believe  that  this  is  an  important  step  towards  understanding 
what  MPE  spam  messages  are  and  towards  designing  a  strong 
weapon against today's evolutionally advanced spammers. 
Currently, we are planning to develop a method to predict spam-
sending  hosts  based  on  the  study  in  this  paper  and  to  conduct 
further evaluation in order to discover optimum parameter T and 
D using more data collected over the longer term.
