Abstract. A High Yield Investment Program (HYIP) is an online Ponzi
scheme, a ﬁnancial fraud that pays outrageous levels of interest using
money from new investors. We call this fraud ‘postmodern’ in that so-
phisticated investors understand the fraud, but hope to proﬁt by joining
early. These investors support ‘aggregators’ – reputation websites that
track the status of HYIPs. We examine 9 months of aggregator data
and show that there is no evidence of collusion between diﬀerent ag-
gregators. We use their data to assess HYIP time to collapse, ﬁnding –
perhaps unsurprisingly – that longer lifetimes are associated with lower
interest payments and longer mandatory investment terms. We look at
the role of digital currencies in supporting HYIPs, ﬁnding that a handful
of systems dominate. Finally, we estimate that this type of criminality
is turning over at least $6 million/month and set out ways in which it
might be disrupted.

Introduction

A High Yield Investment Program (HYIP) is an online version of a ﬁnancial
scam in which investors are promised extremely high rates of return on their in-
vestments. Payments are made to existing investors from the funds deposited by
newcomers, continuing until insuﬃcient funds remain and the scheme collapses.
Similar schemes have operated in the oﬄine world for 150 years or more and are
often called Ponzi schemes after a famous swindler in 1920’s Boston.

Despite being illegal to operate in most jurisdictions, there are a considerable
number of active HYIP websites at any given time. We call them ‘postmodern’
Ponzi schemes because we believe that many of the investors are well aware of
the fraudulent nature of the sites, but believe that by investing at an early stage
– and withdrawing their money before the scheme’s collapse – they will be able
to make a proﬁt at the expense of less savvy investors.

An extensive online ecosystem has developed in support of HYIPs, involving
discussion websites, digital currencies, and third-party ‘aggregator’ websites that
track HYIP performance. These aggregators list dozens of active HYIPs, tracking
core features such as interest rates, minimum investment terms and funding
options. They operate forums in which individuals can report their experiences;

but more signiﬁcantly, the aggregators appear to make their own investments in
some of the HYIPs and report on when interest payments cease. As an illustrative
example, Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the HYIP macrotrade.com, along with
its entry on the aggregator website hyip.com.

We have spent many months collecting data from HYIP websites and ag-
gregators to measure the extent of HYIP activity, so that we can improve our
understanding of this particular type of online criminality.

In Section 2 we explain our data collection and measurement methodology. In
Section 3 we discuss our evidence as to whether the aggregator sites are making
truthful1 reports. In Section 4 we examine HYIP lifetimes and investigate the
extent to which it is possible to predict their collapse. In Section 5 we discuss the
role of ‘digital currencies’ in this ecosystem and then in Section 6 we estimate
the scale of this particular type of online criminality and discuss various ways
that it might be discouraged, if not entirely stamped out. In Section 7 we survey
related work and ﬁnally in Section 8 we summarize what we have learned so far
and consider what further work might reveal.

1 We avoid the word ‘honest’ because this is not an appropriate word to use in con-

junction with criminal activity.

2 Data Collection Methodology

We term the websites that provide reputation services for HYIP programs ‘aggre-
gators’. Given that HYIPs are conﬁdence games that keep growing so long as new
investors can be recruited, these ratings are potentially very powerful indicators
of HYIP success or failure. From a Google search for “HYIP” issued in November
2010, we identiﬁed 9 aggregator websites to monitor (myhyip.com, maxhyip.com,
iehyip.com, hyipranks.com, hyipmonitor.com, hyipinvestment.com, hyip.
com, hothyips.com, and everyhyip.com).

Between November 17, 2010 and August 21, 2011 we made daily visits to each
aggregator website (with the exception of four days in November and December
2010 due to a bug in our crawler). We parsed the pages we fetched to extract the
key characteristics of the HYIPs they listed: interest rate, investment term(s),
user and aggregator ratings, along with payment status (i.e., paying, not paying).
The names aggregators use for each of these ﬁelds varied slightly, so we manually
uniﬁed the terminology and stored each observation in a database. A total of
141 014 observations were made.

All the aggregator websites provide links to the HYIPs, though some of these
links pass via an interstitial page. From January 2011 onwards, we determined
the URL of each of the HYIPs and captured the WHOIS record for each HYIP
domain. Our automated system also visited each HYIP website, and stored the
source ﬁles linked to or loaded from the home page. These daily visits to the
HYIP websites were made over Tor2; its anonymity properties help ensure that
the website would not be able to identify us or trivially connect our visits.

2.1 Measuring HYIP activity

We have used the collected data to derive several key measurements, whose
calculation we now describe.

Linking HYIP records across aggregators. Unfortunately, it can be diﬃcult to
determine when two aggregators are reporting on the same HYIP. We use the
website address of the HYIP as a canonical identiﬁer, but when we failed to
ascertain this (e.g., the HYIP website was shut down before we followed the link),
we have compared the names that the aggregator gave to HYIPs – stripping out
whitespace and punctuation and doing a caseless match.

The 9 aggregators listed 1 576 distinct HYIPs – of these, 211 did not resolve to
a website and could not be identiﬁed as an HYIP which had ever been resolved.
595 HYIPs appeared on more than one aggregator website, while the other 981
appeared only once. It is likely that some of the 981 unique HYIPs are duplicates
that we failed to link up; however, we treat them as distinct in our study.

Measuring HYIP lifetimes. One key measure of HYIP performance is how long
after initial creation the scheme collapses. Identifying when a website is ready for
business is impracticable, so we deem the HYIP lifetime to be the elapsed time
between the HYIP’s ﬁrst appearance as reported by an aggregator site (which
we believe will be contemporaneous with the ﬁrst accounts being created) and
its eventual disappearance from that aggregator (invariably because the HYIP
has collapsed and is no longer paying).

Normalizing proﬁt rates, investment terms, and expected payouts. There is enor-
mous variation in the interest rates promised by HYIPs, from the outrageous
440% in 10 minutes oﬀered by top-capital.com to the comparatively modest
1–2% per day oﬀered by macrotrade.com. Many HYIPs oﬀer a menu of invest-
ment choices that vary by investment level and term, just as a legitimate bank
does for their certiﬁcates of deposit (CDs).

For this paper, we start by normalizing the published interest rates and
investment terms to a daily rate. We then compute an expected payout value
that is standardized across HYIPs. To arrive at the expected payout, we had to
infer a model of how investments grow over time. Subtly diﬀerent phrasing must
be interpreted diﬀerently, as indicated in the following table:

Phrase

Interest Rate Investment Term Expected Payout

x% for y days
x% in y days
x% after y days
x% daily

x%
%
%
x%

y
x

x

y

y
y
y
-

x × y× principal

x× principal
x× principal

-

In every case we do not compound daily on the current value, but compound
on the original principal. In other words, we do not assume that any of the
interest that is paid out will be reinvested. We take this approach because it is
consistent with the returns on investment (ROI) reported by the vast majority of
aggregators. Additionally, if HYIP investors are indeed ‘postmodern’ and know
to take proﬁts as rapidly as possible, then their strategy will be to be avoid
keeping money in any single scheme for too long.

3 Can the Reports of HYIP Aggregators be Trusted?

Given that all HYIPs are fraudulent, it is natural to ask whether the reports from
aggregators should be trusted. While ascertaining ground truth is impossible, we
have devised a number of measurements to assess the relative accuracy of data
reported on HYIPs.

In particular, 595 of the 1 576 HYIPs (38%) are tracked by at least two
aggregators and so we can compare the reports about the same HYIP across
diﬀerent aggregators. If there is rough consensus then, either the aggregation
sites are in a universal conspiracy, or they are independently assessing the HYIPs
in a truthful manner.

3.1 Reporting of HYIP Attributes

We determined what the aggregators reported to be the maximum and minimum
investment levels allowed by the HYIP, the referral rates oﬀered to aﬃliates
for signing up new investors, and the withdrawal method oﬀered (automatic,
manual, or instant). When we collate this information and look for similarity we
get these results:

0.72

0.87
0.94

0.44
0.77

0.43
0.75

-

0.88

The ﬁrst row of this table reports the fraction of HYIPs where all aggregator
reports are in perfect agreement. As can be seen, for 40% of HYIPs, the maximum
allowed investment values are in agreement, while 87% of the time the minimum
investment value is reported to be the same by diﬀerent aggregators.

Of course these attributes are all matters of fact, which the aggregator will
have obtained from the HYIP websites (or perhaps from the ﬁlling in of a form).
However, the aggregators are imperfect and errors are being made. If there was
collusion between aggregators and HYIPs then we would have expected to see
perfect agreement – either from better channels of communication, or from a
consistent set of mistakes being made.

By contrast, when we consider the amount of money that the aggregators
report that they have in invested into particular HYIPs, we see very little agree-
ment at all:

Aggregator Investment

Perfect Agreement
Diversity Index

0.10
0.51

Any investment at all allows the aggregators to assess whether the HYIP
is paying, and we have just noted there is reasonable agreement about what
the minimum value might be. Therefore, we presume that the amounts being
invested reﬂect the initial opinion of the aggregator about the prospects for the
HYIP. If there was some kind of universal conspiracy then we would expect to
see consistency here, but the aggregators invest the same amount of money into
HYIPs in only 10% of cases.

Naturally, even when there isn’t unanimous agreement across aggregators,
it could still be the case that almost all of aggregators report the same values.
Consequently, the two tables also report Simpson’s diversity index [1] for each
attribute. This measures the similarity of a sample population and it is computed
as the sum of the squares of all the probabilities for each attribute value, with
a 0 score showing complete diversity and complete uniformity giving a score
of 1. Once again, using this measure, we see a high, but imperfect, agreement
on matters of fact, but continuing diversity in the investment amount.

3.2 Reporting of HYIP Lifetimes

We now consider the elapsed time between when HYIPs are reported to be
created – or at least when the aggregator learns of their existence – and when
the HYIPs collapse and the aggregator is no longer prepared to track them.

Figure 2 (left) plots the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the
standard deviations of the reported starting and ending times of HYIPs across
aggregators. For around 80% of HYIPs, the standard deviation is very small, at
most a few days. However, for the remaining 20% of HYIPs, there is substantial
disagreement between aggregators. Furthermore, that disagreement is greater
for the last observed time for an HYIP than for the starting time, as indicated
by the slightly lower blue dashed line than solid red line in the graph. This is not
surprising, given that deciding when to drop an HYIP from results is more of a
judgement call for an aggregator than deciding whether to report its existence.
The green dotted line plots the standard deviations for an alternative measure
of HYIP collapse. Aggregators keep track of their own investments in HYIPs,
reporting each day the cumulative return on investment (ROI). Often, the ROI
will ‘ﬂat-line’ – suddenly stop changing – a few days before the aggregator stops
tracking the program, because the HYIP is no longer paying out. Hence, we
can view the time when the ROI stops changing as an alternative indicator
of collapse. As the graph indicates, there is even more variation here – some
aggregators stop receiving payments before others. Again, this is not surprising,
since HYIPs may not stop all payments at once.

Aggregators generally agree on lifetime, but when there are diﬀerences they
can be large, so for lifetime value we use the median of the aggregator reports.
By using the median (rather than computing the mean), we are better protected
against a highly divergent aggregator polluting the overall measure.

Overall, our analysis of aggregator reports is that there is no evidence of
collusion, but that their measurements are generally consistent, and that our
further analysis based on the median of aggregator values will be robust.

4 The Collapse of HYIP Programs

An HYIP scheme collapses when it can no longer make the interest payments
that it has promised. While it may not have completely run out of money, a
rational HYIP operator will eventually conclude that paying the next round of
interest payments (or refunding someone’s capital) is less lucrative than shutting
the scheme down and absconding. These calculations are slightly diﬀerent in cy-
berspace than for real world Ponzi schemes because there will be no bankruptcy
and no liquidators checking to see if any value can be salvaged from the ruins.

4.1 How Long do HYIPs Survive?

One subtlety in measuring HYIP lifetimes is that some schemes remained viable
at the end of our study, making it impossible to observe when these schemes

ultimately collapsed. This can be solved using survival analysis: the 187 (12% of
the 1 576 total) HYIPs that were still operational at the end of our investigation
are said to be ‘right-censored’.

A survival function S(t) measures the probability that an HYIP’s lifetime is
greater than time t. This is similar to a complementary cumulative distribution
function, except that the censored data points must be taken into account and
the probabilities estimated. We use the standard Kaplan-Meier estimator [2] to
calculate a survival function for HYIP lifetimes.

Figure 2 (right), has a logarithmic x-axis and plots the observed survival
function for HYIPs (using the median observed lifetimes across all aggregators).
The solid blue line indicates the survival function computed using the HYIP’s
last observed time, while the green dotted line plots the survival function using
the ROI ﬂat-line method described in the previous section. For very short-lived
HYIPs (i.e., less than one week), the lifetime measured using the ROI ﬂat-line
method is considerably shorter. However, for longer-lived schemes, the lifetimes
are nearly indistinguishable, so we ignore the ROI ﬂat-line method for subsequent
analysis, and just use the median of the lifetime values.

The survival function data shows us that the while the median lifetime of
HYIPs is just 28 days, one in four will last more than three months, and one in
ten for more than ten months. That is, although many HYIPs collapse almost
immediately, a substantial minority persist for a very long time.

Fig. 3. HYIPs with lower daily interest rates tend to last longer before collapsing (left);
HYIPs with longer mandatory investment periods tend to survive longer (right).

4.2 What Factors Aﬀect HYIP Time-to-Collapse?

Given such regular turnover and wide variation in lifetimes, it is natural to
wonder what might prolong or trigger collapse.

Figure 3 examines how the generosity of the HYIP investment terms aﬀects
the observed lifetimes. On the left, box plots for HYIP lifetimes are given that
span diﬀerent proﬁt rates. When an HYIP oﬀers a less generous proﬁt rate (less
than a few percent daily), there is a greater chance that the HYIP will survive for
longer. Once the proﬁt rates become more outlandish (such as the half of HYIPs
oﬀering more than 10% daily returns), HYIP lifetimes are more consistently
short. We conclude that the oﬀering of higher rates of return does not bring in
suﬃcient investment to oﬀset the cost of servicing existing commitments.

Another factor is the minimum investment period required by the HYIP.
Figure 3 (right) plots HYIP lifetimes sorted by investment term. As expected,
HYIPs that require longer investment terms tend to be more stable. However,
we note that there is still substantial variation in lifetime even for less gener-
ous interest rates and longer investment terms. Evidently, some HYIPs cannot
attract enough investment to sustain even these more modest programs.

4.3 Can Users or Aggregators Predict Collapse?

Several aggregators rate HYIP ‘quality’, often on a scale of zero to ﬁve stars.
The rating can vary considerably over time, ostensibly according to the risk
level associated with the scheme. Some aggregators also compile user ratings,
typically collected in the form of positive (and sometimes negative) votes. We
now examine how the crowd’s rating compares to that of the curator’s.

We focus on the four aggregators that report both user and aggregator ratings
on a ﬁnite scale. Some aggregators simply tally the total number of user votes,

Empirical Analysis of High-Yield Investment Programs

while others report the absolute diﬀerence between positive and negative votes.
We exclude these reports from our analysis to ease comparisons. The ratings we
study are based on a score of zero to ﬁve, zero to ten, or out of 100; we normalize
all ratings to a percentage.

While the ratings have been collected throughout an HYIP’s lifespan, we have
decided to take a closer look at the rating given 7 days prior to each HYIP’s
collapse. A low rating issued at this point would indicate to prospective investors
that the bottom will soon fall out (if it has not already). The results are given
in the following table.

Overall, user ratings are consistently much more positive than aggregator
ratings. Consider the ratings for hyipranks.com: the average user rating one
week prior to collapse is 96%. Across all HYIPs, 96% were awarded a user score
of 80% or higher, but only 4% had a score below 50%. By contrast, the average
assessment directly issued by hyipranks.com is only 35%. Moreover, 89% of
HYIPs are given a low score, compared to just 7% that receive a score over 80%.
Why do we see such divergence in ratings? Those who have already invested
in an HYIP have a very strong incentive to attract new investors. Consequently,
they are highly motivated to vote early and often in support of their investment.
The aggregators, on the other hand, fully expect HYIPs to collapse and must
provide more accurate assessments in order to gain the trust of visitors. Viewed
in this way, it is not surprising that the crowd will not accurately predict collapse.

5 The Role of Digital Currencies

Digital currencies are an essential component of a functioning HYIP ecosystem.
They allow investors to convert local hard currency into a multi-national form
that is suitable for transfers to and from the HYIP. Occasionally an HYIP will
directly accept wire transfers or credit card payments. However, this is unusual
because if the HYIP operator works within the traditional ﬁnancial system, then
they risk being identiﬁed when the fraud collapses, and they will be less sure
that they will be able to hang on to any proﬁts.

We found that 22 currencies were accepted for use at the HYIPs we tracked.
Most of these were only oﬀered by a handful of HYIPs (including 14 HYIPs
that took PayPal, 7 Moneybookers and 1 Western Union). We list the six most
common currencies below and note that the most common, by far, were Liberty

Digital currencies are riskier than traditional currencies for both the investor
and the HYIP operator. When the time comes to cash in and convert back to
hard currency, the exchange rate may have changed signiﬁcantly, or there may
be no liquidity – if many of the customers of a digital currency simultaneously
ask to cash in their holdings, then the currency’s operators may not be able to
pay up (e.g., the HYIP-associated StrictPay currency appears to have collapsed
in this way [3]).

The digital currencies that HYIPs accept have terms and conditions that
forbid their use with HYIPs. This creates the additional risk that assets could
be frozen or conﬁscated for violating the rules. Furthermore, any digital currency
that facilitates widespread criminality runs the risk of being shut down by law
enforcement, as happened to e-gold [4].

Liberty Reserve has a warning on its website advising against investing in
HYIPs, noting that payments are ‘non-revocable’ and that they cannot be held
liable for fraudulent activities by its users. Such admonishments raise the ques-
tion: how much of these currencies’ proﬁts come from HYIP activity?

We attempt to shed light on this by examining the backlinks from other
websites into the currency websites. We used Yahoo Site Explorer3 to gather
1 000 backlinks for each of the most common currencies and calculated what
proportion of the incoming links came from HYIP-related websites. The results
are listed in the right-most column of the table.

72% of the backlinks to Perfect Money are from HYIP-related websites, as
are 33% of the backlinks to LibertyReserve. This leads us to conclude that a
substantial proportion of the revenue to these currencies comes from HYIPs.
Note that for AlertPay, the third-most popular currency, only 10% of the incom-
ing links are from HYIPs. Indeed, many of AlertPay’s other incoming links are
from legitimate businesses, such as the web-hosting company prodhosting.net,
which uses AlertPay to process payments. AlertPay is based in Canada, and that
may mean that they are more easily pressured by ﬁrst world regulators, than
the currencies based in Panama and Costa Rica.

6 Policy Options for Disrupting the HYIP Ecosystem

One of the ﬁrst questions to ask when considering policy interventions into online
scams is how prevalent the scam is. If only a few people are aﬀected, then the
criminality may not be worth pursuing, especially when – as in this case – many
of the investors are aware that the sites are fundamentally fraudulent.

It is diﬃcult to directly measure how many people and how much money
are invested in HYIPs. However, we can use some publicly available proxies to
derive an order-of-magnitude estimate of HYIP impact.

As part of its Adwords program, Google oﬀers a Keyword Tool that returns
similar search phrases to those given as input.4 We entered the phrases “hyip”
and “high yield investment program”, and were returned 100 closely related
phrases. Google also oﬀers a related service called Traﬃc Estimator that esti-
mates for any phrase the number of global monthly searches. We plugged all 102
HYIP-related phrases into the tool to arrive at an estimate of 441 000 monthly
searches for these terms on Google.

We can use this value to create a rough estimate of the monthly investment

levels to HYIPs using the following formula:

$ HYIP invest

month

=

# Google mo. searches
Google market share

× % invest × invest amount

Google’s global market share in search is known to be 64.4% but the other
terms in this equation are much harder to estimate. We do not have reliable
data on the fraction of users who learn about HYIPs that ultimately invest, or
how much money they put in. A plausible, conservative, guess is that at least
1% of people who search for HYIPs go on to invest in an HYIP. Researchers
investigating spam-advertised pharmaceuticals found that 0.5% of site visitors
added items to their shopping carts [5], while in an earlier study they found an
approximately 8% conversion rate for non-pharmaceutical goods [6]. Leontiadis
et al. estimated that between 0.3% and 3% of people looking for drugs via web
search ultimately purchased the goods from illicit retailers [7]. While the invest-
ment rate for HYIPs could undoubtedly diﬀer from that for pharmaceuticals,
these data points do suggest that a 1% conversion rate for HYIPs is plausible.
From observation of the statistical information that some sites provide, we
will guess that the average investment is $1 000. Plugging these numbers into
the above formula we estimate that HYIPs attract at least $6 million per month
in revenue.

Given that around 600 000 people search for HYIPs each month, we conclude
that HYIPs are indeed a substantial scam worthy of policymakers’ attention. So
what should be done? We now consider a range of interventions and assess their
likely impact.

Option 1: Engage Law Enforcement. Given that HYIPs are illegal in nearly all
jurisdictions, it is logical to seek the support of law enforcement. In the US, the

Commodity Futures Exchange Commission (CFTC) has been given the power
to enforce violations of the Commodities Exchange Act of 1936. The CFTC
regularly uncovers Ponzi schemes whose perpetrators and victims are based in
the US. International cooperation is possible: the CFTC recently arrested Jeﬀrey
Lowrance and extradited him from Peru for allegedly running a Ponzi scheme
that solicited investors via the Internet [8]. Consequently, engaging the CFTC
could lead to successful criminal prosecution.

However, the usual warnings about prosecuting online crime [9] apply: col-
lecting evidence across international borders is diﬃcult, slow and expensive; the
perpetrators may be located in countries unwilling to cooperate. Google’s data
shows that that 85% of HYIP-related searches are made from outside the US, so
victims will be spread across the globe, necessitating an international response.
Policy interventions that apply pressure to key intermediaries have histori-
cally been one of the most successful ways to address illicit activity online. For
example, the US Unlawful Internet Enforcement Act of 2006 has largely elimi-
nated online gambling by US residents by requiring payment processors to block
credit-card payments to oﬀshore gambling sites. The Digital Millenium Copy-
right Act of 1998 created a notice-and-takedown regime whereby online service
providers receive immunity for complying with take-down requests issued by
copyright holders. So we now turn to considering potential intermediaries that
might be enlisted to disrupt the HYIP ecosystem.

Option 2: Target Digital Currencies. The digital currencies that HYIPs rely on
for customer accounts are a logical target. As shown in Section 5, a handful
of currencies facilitate most HYIP transactions. The biggest oﬀenders (Liberty
Reserve and Perfect Money) are undoubtedly aware of their role in funding
HYIPs, so bringing it to their attention is unlikely to make any diﬀerence. The
banking regulators in their claimed home countries (Costa Rica and Panama)
might be persuaded to cooperate with an outside crackdown. However, even if
they stopped processing HYIP payments, it is likely that alternative currencies
would come to the fore.

Option 3: Squeeze Credit-Card Payments. Another option is to block the funding
of digital currencies by credit cards. At present, a credit card can be used to
fund the most popular digital currencies, including Liberty Reserve and Perfect
Money. Although this is an obvious opportunity to apply pressure, it might
prove diﬃcult to identify all the intermediaries that can supply the currency,
and ultimately the traﬃc would shift to wire transfers instead.

Option 4: Undermine Aggregators. A more promising approach is to disrupt the
aggregators, since they are essential for establishing trust in HYIP transactions.
For example, one could target the registrars that have registered the domains
in use. Persistent websites are essential for establishing the reputation of the
aggregators, so they are more likely to be adversely aﬀected by a domain name
seizure than, say, malware-distributing sites. Many aggregators are currently
served by North American companies (e.g., hyip.com and hyipranks.com are

Empirical Analysis of High-Yield Investment Programs

registered through GoDaddy, maxhyip.com is on Tucows, and hyip.com is for
sale by American domain-parking ﬁrm Sedo). However, this is likely to require
new legislation, since the aggregators are merely describing and linking to the
HYIP sites. It could be some time before such legislation was in place in the
USA, let alone in all the jurisdictions to which the sites could move.

Alternatively, the aggregators’ income stream could be disrupted. Four of
the nine aggregators we studied – hyip.com, iehyip.com, hyipranks.com and
hyipinvestment.com – are members of the Google Display Network. Google,
and the other advertising networks, might choose not to work with sites that
knowingly link to fraudulent sites. Whether stopping this source of income would
cause all the sites to close cannot be known for certain, but it is relatively
straightforward, and arguably in the best interests of the advertising networks
to cease their ﬁnancial association with criminality comparison sites.

Option 5: Target most the successful HYIPs. A ﬁnal option is to attempt to
expedite the demise of HYIP websites. While this might appear a hopelessly dif-
ﬁcult task given that we have observed around 1 600 HYIPs in just nine months
of data collection, targeting the small number of long-lived HYIPs could be eﬀec-
tive. A long-lived HYIP is bound to be continuing to attract many victims, since
new recruits are needed to prolong the life of the scam. Consequently, eﬀorts to
disrupt these programs are very likely to reap substantial rewards.

Over one third (49) of the 141 HYIPs that have been online for more than
six months are registered via eNom, a US-based registrar. 26 are registered
through Indian-based Directi, along with another 14 on US-based GoDaddy.
Consequently, making registrars aware of the criminal behavior being facilitated
by these websites could trigger a short-term disruption.

On balance, while each of the discussed options may help, we expect that
options 4 and 5 are likely to be most helpful for disrupting the current HYIP
ecosystem. We also believe that action by law enforcement (option 1) could do
a lot of good in the longer term.

7 Related Work

During the past decade, online criminality has proliferated [9]. In response, a
number of measurement studies have quantiﬁed various frauds and recommended
suitable interventions . Of particular relevance are studies that examine user
susceptibility to various scams, such as fake antivirus [10,11] and extortionate
social-engineering scams [12]. Stajano and Wilson identify seven principles com-
mon to oﬄine scams that often translate into online scams [13]. At least ﬁve of
these principles apply to HYIP investment: the herd principle (false safety in
numbers), the dishonesty principle (victim’s own illegal behavior held against
him), deception principle (things are not what they seem), need and greed prin-
ciple (desperation increases vulnerability), and the time principle (time pressures
increase bad choices). Consequently, while we believe that many HYIP investors
are likely to be aware of the fraudulent nature of their investment, they are

nonetheless being masterfully deceived by con artists. Furthermore, it is entirely
plausible that some victims fully believe in the legitimacy of their investment.

The use and abuse of digital currencies has been examined since the inception
of the Financial Cryptography conference. Optimists pointed to the potential to
enhance revenue [14] or freedom through anonymity [15]. However, even in these
early days, others fretted about the potential for abuse of digital cash, such as
money laundering [16]. More recently, Anderson identiﬁed non-revocability as
the key feature of digital payments that appeals most to online criminals [17].
Indeed, the non-revocability of payments issued in the currencies underpinning
the HYIP ecosystem is essential for its successful operation.

The security and reliability of crowdsourcing in information security appli-
cations has been investigated by Moore and Clayton [18] (phishing) and Chia
and Knapskog [19] (web security). These papers discuss the distinct challenges
of crowdsourcing applications when participants may be motivated to lie, as we
have found for users promoting ﬂagging HYIPs.

A ﬁnal area of relevant work is in the examination of interventions to com-
bat online crime. In an expansive study of goods advertised by email spam,
Levchenko et al. [20] found substantial concentration in the registrars used by
spam-advertised websites. They also found that only 3 banks processed the bulk
of payments. We report similar levels of concentration in the HYIP ecosystem.
Clayton found that shutting down hosting providers that facilitate spam trans-
mission can have a disruptive short term eﬀect [21]. Finally, Liu et al. [22] ex-
amine the prospects of enlisting registrars to suspend ‘known bad’ domains,
concluding that the criminals are more adept at shifting to new domains faster
than the oﬀending domains can be suspended. While this may be true for do-
mains used in email spam, we are more optimistic for registrar-level intervention
in combating HYIPs due to the persistence of successful schemes.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented the ﬁrst detailed analysis of HYIPs – fraudulent online Ponzi
schemes. We have provided some baseline measurements by leveraging data from
the aggregator sites that exist to help investors pick where to place their money.
We have shown that the aggregators are basically truthful, and used their data
to show that HYIPs last longer with lower interest rates delays before payments
are made. We have also shown that the aggregators are better than ‘the crowd’
in warning of HYIP collapse, which we believe is directly related to the crowd
actively wishing to hype the prospects of the HYIP they are invested in.

Nontheless, this paper has only scraped the surface in measuring and un-
derstanding HYIPs, and there is much more data to collect and process. It is
already clear to us that many of the sites are related to each other as criminals
create new instances to replace HYIPs that have collapsed. We have been un-
able, so far, to use WHOIS data to identify serial oﬀenders but we expect to
make headway when we consider the structure and content of the websites.

We are particularly interested in the subset of HYIPs that provide a running
commentary on the number of accounts opened, and the sums of money being
invested, withdrawn and paid out as interest. We hope to use these to build
a better model of HYIP collapse, and provide better estimates of the sums of
money passing through these criminal enterprises.

As we extend our analysis and measurement of harm, we intend to ensure that
this paper’s other key contribution – a detailed analysis of how this criminality
might be disrupted – may be of even greater relevance to policy makers.
