ABSTRACT
During the last few years, more and more of the medium-to-large
Internet eXchange Points (IXP) around the world have started to
operate a route server and offer its use as a free value-added service
to their members. This service has greatly simpliﬁed inter-domain
routing for those members and has made it easy for them to peer
with possibly hundreds of networks at those IXPs from the get-go.
In this paper, we report on an empirical analysis that is based
on a unique collection of IXP-provided datasets from two different
European IXPs that operate a route server and gave us access to a
wealth of route server-speciﬁc BGP data. Both IXPs also made the
trafﬁc datasets that they routinely collect from their public switch-
ing infrastructures available to us. Using this information, we per-
form a ﬁrst-of-its-kind study that correlates a detailed control plane
view with a rich data plane view to reason about the different peer-
ing options available at these IXPs and how some of the major In-
ternet players make use of them. In the process, we highlight the
important role that the IXPs’ route servers play for inter-domain
routing in today’s Internet and demonstrate the beneﬁts of studying
IXP peerings in a manner that is not agnostic but fully aware of
trafﬁc. We conclude with a discussion of some of the ramiﬁcations
of our ﬁndings for both network researchers and operators.

INTRODUCTION

There are currently some 350+ Internet eXchange Points (IXP)
worldwide, and some of the largest and most successful IXPs have
more than 500-600 members and carry as much trafﬁc as some of
the global Tier-1 ISPs. With membership growth rates of 10-20%
per year and annual trafﬁc growth rates of 50-100%, these IXPs
have emerged as key entities in the Internet infrastructure where a

vast majority of today’s peering connections are established. This
growing importance of IXPs for the Internet peering ecosystem and
the IXPs’ increasing popularity with the full spectrum of Internet
players have come in full view with recent studies such as [17, 21,
25, 36].

One of the main reasons for this emergence of IXPs as some of
the most densely connected physical components in today’s Inter-
net has been the fact that many of them have started to offer the use
of route servers (RSes)1 as a free value-added service to their mem-
bers. In essence, using an IXP’s RS greatly simpliﬁes routing for
its members – a member AS has to set up just a single BGP session
to connect to possibly hundreds of other member ASes. That is,
most members use an IXP’s RS to establish multi-lateral peerings
(i.e., one-to-many) as compared to bi-lateral peerings (i.e., one-
to-one). However, except for the fact that the peering fabrics of
IXPs with RSes are signiﬁcantly richer than of those that don’t of-
fer a RS, little is known in general about how IXPs operate RSes
or how the members of such IXPs incorporate the use of RSes in
their decision-making process that ultimately determines what sort
of trafﬁc is sent to/received from which of the other IXP members
over what type of peering links.

The main contribution of this paper is an original and in-depth
study of IXP RSes, from their architecture and deployment “in the
wild” to their use by today’s wide spectrum of Internet players.
Our study combines a detailed control plane view of IXP-related
peerings with a corresponding rich data plane view to examine how
IXPs operate their RSes and, at the same time, reason about the
different peering decisions that networks make when they connect
with other networks at today’s IXPs. To perform this analysis, we
rely on our ongoing collaboration with an increasing number of
European IXPs, which provided us access to a unique collection
of datasets. Two of the IXPs operate a RS and gave us access to
RS-speciﬁc BGP data and also made the trafﬁc datasets that they
routinely collect available to us.2

By correlating connectivity-related with trafﬁc-speciﬁc aspects
of peering at the level of individual links as well as routed preﬁxes,
our analysis highlights the important role that the IXPs’ RSes have
started to play with respect to inter-domain routing in today’s Inter-
net. Among the key observations of our study are:

• RSes are key enablers for offering new and complex peer-
ing options to IXP members and also providing open access
to a signiﬁcant portion of Internet routes. At our IXPs, the
1Note, while the term “route server” often refers to a “route collec-
tor/monitor” or “Routeviews server”, we use it exclusively to refer
to an IXP route server [29, 31] as deﬁned in Section 2.2.
2We also have data from a third, small European IXP; however,
since this small IXP does not operate a route server, its data is not
a focus of this paper.

31preﬁxes advertised via the RSes cover some 80-95% of the
trafﬁc and include many popular destinations.
• Due to the popularity of RSes, multi-lateral peering increas-
ingly dominates classical bi-lateral peering in terms of num-
ber of peerings but not in terms of trafﬁc; in fact, the majority
of the trafﬁc at our IXPs traverses bi-lateral peerings. Never-
theless, some of the top trafﬁc contributors at each IXP use
mainly multi-lateral peering.
• RS usage varies across IXPs and IXP members; while we
observe certain patterns of RS usage among IXP members
with similar business types, we illustrate the wide range of
existing peering strategies with a number of case studies in-
volving key Internet players as well as networks with inter-
estingly complex peering setups.

These ﬁndings have ramiﬁcations for a number of recent devel-
opments that involve network operators and researchers alike. In
particular, as many network operators are eagerly experimenting
with and scrutinizing the wealth of peering alternatives that IXPs
provide (e.g., to reduce transit costs, increase performance and ro-
bustness), a number of researchers are either exploring the evo-
lution of the peering ecosystem as a whole or examine ways to
innovate inter-domain routing. We contribute to each of these de-
velopments by providing an in-depth assessment of peering at IXPs
with an emphasis on understanding and highlighting the role of IXP
RSes in these different efforts.

For example, the recently launched Open-IX initiative [11] aims
at establishing European-style IXPs in the USA. Its main objective
is to increase the diversity in available peering options for networks
in the US where the cost associated with the dominant form of in-
terconnection (i.e., private peering or cross connects) is almost six
times as much as in Europe [15], mainly because of limited com-
petitive interconnection options. To understand the current Internet
peering ecosystem and inform studies concerned with its evolution
over time, our work provides a ﬁrst in-depth look into a market-
place (i.e., Europe) where, thanks to the popularity of IXP RSes,
networks have in general an abundance of interconnection options
and have already acquired certain skills in using the available op-
tions strategically in support of their particular business.

At the same time, researchers have recently recognized the im-
portance of the growing popularity of IXPs for trying to fundamen-
tally improving inter-domain routing. In fact, the main premise of
the work on Software Deﬁned eXchanges (SDX) [27] is that IXPs
are ideal venues for deploying new technologies such as Software
Deﬁned Networking (SDN) – only the mechanisms used at the IXP
itself (e.g., RS operation) need to be changed while the rest of the
Internet can remain unchanged. As a ﬁrst account of practical RS
usage “in the wild” that illustrates the innovative use of today’s
RSes for inter-domain routing, our work complements and informs
these recent efforts. In particular, it contributes to the identiﬁca-
tion of new IXP service offerings that are beyond the capabilities
of today’s RSes but can be fully supported when relying on new
technologies such as SDN.

Moreover, for the Internet measurement community, we demon-
strate how our proprietary datasets can be used “for the good of
science”; that is, calibrating the quality of the latest BGP measure-
ments that are becoming publicly obtainable via Looking Glasses
on some IXP RSes. By showing what parts of the ground truth of
the peering fabrics of those IXPs are visible in these publicly avail-
able datasets and observing that the vast majority of the observed
IXP trafﬁc is destined to the RS preﬁxes, we signiﬁcantly increase
the value that these publicly available datasets will have for future
studies by third parties.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 is an
introduction to RS design and operation. In Section 3, we describe
the different sets of control and data plane measurements that are
available to us. We use this data in Section 4 to revisit connectivity-
related issues and rely on it in Section 5 to study usage-related as-
pects of peerings. Moving beyond the traditional link perspective of
peerings, we examine in Section 6 peering opportunities and trafﬁc
at the level of routed preﬁxes. We provide a longitudinal study of
peering at IXPs in Section 7. We then study how different players
implement peering in Section 8. We conclude in Section 9 and 10
with a discussion of trends in Internet peering and related open re-
search problems.

2. TRENDS IN IXP OPERATIONS

IXPs offer a shared switching fabric where the members can ex-
change trafﬁc with one another once they have established peering
connections (public peering) between them. This generic service
provided by IXPs is an example of a (positive) network effect (also
known as network externality [34]) because the more members an
IXP has, the more valuable that IXP is to each member. Especially
in Europe where many IXPs operate on a not-for-proﬁt basis [21],
this observation has led to signiﬁcant innovations at IXPs in the
form of constantly expanding service offerings.
2.1 Background and motivation

An important example of a new IXP service offering has been the
free use of IXP-operated RSes. With more IXPs operating RSes,
the membership base of those IXPs keeps growing and more of
their member ASes start using the RS service. The resulting prolif-
eration of multi-lateral peerings creates new options for the mem-
ber ASes to peer with one another which, in turn, causes them to
reconsider their existing peering arrangements. At the same time,
the ease with which networks can join IXPs and start using them
has led to a trend whereby one and the same AS can be a member
at multiple IXPs, often within the same city or geographic region.
In effect, offering the free use of their RSes has created a posi-
tive feedback loop for those IXPs. With more networks connecting
to such an IXP, more member ASes use its RS and connect with
most or all other members at the RS. This increases connectivity
and typically also trafﬁc, which in turn attracts yet more networks
to join the IXP. Thus, while we are observing an Internet peering
ecosystem in ﬂux, a pre-requisite for studying the current system
to ultimately reason about its evolutionary path is to have a basic
understanding of “all things concerning RSes.” Given the central
role that IXP RSes play in this paper, we describe in this section
the basic operations of an IXP RS and discuss the main reason for
the observed bandwagon effect.
2.2 The IXP RS as enabler

The typical way to establish connectivity between two ASes is
to establish a direct BGP session between two of their respective
border routers. Initially, if two IXP member ASes wanted to ex-
change trafﬁc via the IXP’s switching fabric, they had to establish
a bi-lateral (BL) BGP peering session at the IXP. However, as IXPs
grew in size, to be able to exchange trafﬁc with most or all of the
other member ASes at an IXP and hence reap the beneﬁts of its
own membership, a member’s border router had to maintain more
and more individual BGP sessions. This started to create adminis-
trative overhead, operational burden, and the potential of pushing
some router hardware to its limit.

To simplify routing for its members, IXPs introduced RSes and
offered them as a free value-added service to their members. In
short, an IXP RS is a process that collects routing information from

the RS’s peers or participants (i.e., IXP members that connect to the
RS), executes its own BGP decision process, and re-advertises the
resulting information (i.e., best route selection) to all of the RS’s
peer routers. Figure 1 shows the ﬂow of control plane information
(BGP sessions) and data packets (data plane) for both traditional
bi-lateral peering as well as peering via the RS at an IXP. The lat-
ter is referred to as multi-lateral (ML) peering because it typically
involves more than two BGP partners.

A member AS just connects to the RS via a single BGP session to
set up BGP peering with all other IXP members that peer with the
RS.3 Clearly, this lowers the maintenance overhead, in particular
for small ASes. Note, however, that using the RS (i.e., ML peer-
ing) does not preclude BL peering by one and the same member
AS. In particular, larger ASes can take advantage of the RS while
still having the option to establish BL peerings with selectively-
chosen IXP members. For example, if a large member AS ﬁnds
the capabilities of the RS to be insufﬁcient for its needs (e.g., with
respect to trafﬁc engineering or ﬁltering) or prefers to have more
control over the peerings with its most important peers, it can use
BL peerings with the latter and ML peerings with those members
that peer with the IXP’s RS.

Note that the IXP RS is not involved in the data path. Moreover,
it executes the BGP decision process based on the information it
learns from its peers. Thus, there is no guarantee that the best route
selected by the RS is the same as the one that the peer would have
selected given a full set of BL peering sessions. In this sense, while
using a RS solves a scalability problem, it has the potential of cre-
ating a new problem known as the hidden path problem [31]. For
example, if different peers of the IXP’s RS advertise routes for the
same preﬁx, only one route will be selected and re-advertised to
all other peers. If this route cannot be propagated to a certain peer
(e.g., because of export ﬁltering restrictions), that peer will not be
able to receive any route for this preﬁx, even though an alterna-
tive path was advertised to the RS by a different peer. While this
hidden path problem was an issue with earlier versions of RS soft-
ware, recent advances have largely overcome the problem, and in
Section 2.4, we describe a popular Internet routing daemon that
addresses this problem by providing support for maintaining peer-
speciﬁc routing tables. We recall that a similar problem also occurs
in the context of large ISPs where route reﬂectors are used to redis-
tribute routes to iBGP peers [20].
2.3 On the deployment history of RSes

The ﬁrst RSes were designed and deployed in the US as part of
the decommissioning of the NSFNET around 1995 [26]. However,
3For redundancy purposes, IXPs typically operate two RSes and
encourage their members to connect to both RSes.

the service never took off due to the small size of the largest US
IXPs at that time (i.e., MAE-East’s membership approached some
20 ASes in mid-1990).4

Although some IXPs (e.g., DE-CIX in Frankfurt) offered the use
of a route server as early as mid-1990, it took another 10 years and
the increasing popularity of some European IXPs for the RS con-
cept to re-emerge and gain momentum. In fact, around 2005 an in-
creasing number of European IXPs already offered RS capabilities
to their members. The de-facto RS at that time was Quagga [14].
However, early versions of Quagga suffered from the hidden path
problem and had numerous operational problems (e.g., preﬁx ﬁl-
tering, resource consumption, performance limitations) [30, 32].
Later versions of Quagga and OpenBGPD [12] addressed most of
these problems and started to be deployed around 2008. Difﬁcul-
ties with its maintenance prevented OpenBGPD from being widely
adopted and deployed [38].

In 2008, the BIRD [16] project was relaunched (the initial project
dates back to 1999), and it took just three years for BIRD to become
the most popular IXP route server [4]. Figure 2 shows a time line
when some of the larger IXPs migrated to BIRD. In fact, the suc-
cess of BIRD goes beyond RSes. Since 2013, it is the core routing
component of the Netﬂix Open Connect Appliance [10].
2.4 BIRD: A popular router daemon for RSes
BIRD is an open-source software routing daemon. The project
was launched in 2008. The software was developed by CZ.NIC
Labs and has been actively supported by the IXP community. In
the following, we describe a BIRD conﬁguration that has been ab-
stracted from the Euro-IX RS example [4] and is the basis of the
one in operational use by one of the IXPs with which we have an
ongoing collaboration.

Like all routing daemons, BIRD maintains a Routing Informa-
tion Base (RIB) which contains all BGP paths that it receives from
its peers – the Master RIB. However, when using BIRD as RS, it
can be conﬁgured to (i) maintain peer-speciﬁc RIBs and (ii) use
them instead of the Master RIB for peer-speciﬁc BGP best path se-
lection (see Figure 3). When conﬁgured this way, each member AS
that peers with the RS maintains a BGP session with the RS, which
results in a peer-speciﬁc RIB. When IXP member AS X advertises
a preﬁx to the RS, it is ﬁrst put into the AS X-speciﬁc RIB. Next,
if this preﬁx passes the AS X-speciﬁc import ﬁlter, it is added to
the RS’ Master RIB. If the export ﬁlter of AS X allows it, then this
preﬁx will also be added to each AS Y-speciﬁc RIB, where AS Y
is any other IXP member that connects to the RS. Then the RS per-
forms a peer-speciﬁc best path selection and exports the preﬁx by
re-advertising it to each AS Y.

IXPs typically apply import ﬁlters to ensure that each mem-
ber AS only advertises routes that it should advertise. To derive
import ﬁlters, the IXPs usually rely on route registries such as
IRR [7]. This policy limits the likelihood of unintended preﬁx hi-

jacking and/or advertisements of bogon preﬁxes including private
address space. With respect to export ﬁlters, they are typically trig-
gered by the IXP members themselves to restrict the set of other
IXP member ASes that receive their routes. The commonly used
vehicle for achieving this objective is to tag route advertisements to
the RS with RS-speciﬁc BGP community values [24]. These values
are set on a per route basis and restrict to which members the route
can be propagated. Thus, by using export ﬁlters, peers of the RS
can express policies.

Using peer-speciﬁc RIBs overcomes the hidden path problem,
because the BGP decision process is executed for each peer in-
dependently.
If the best route for a certain preﬁx cannot be re-
advertised to some particular members (e.g., because of export ﬁl-
ters), the RS can still select and advertise an alternative route to
those particular members – presuming that another, non-blocked
route is available.5 Maintaining separate RIBs for each RS peer has
a cost in terms of memory requirements and processing capabili-
ties. However, recent stress tests and real deployment performance
reports for BIRD at large IXPs [22, 33, 32] show that maintaining
about 400 RIBs, each with up to 100K preﬁxes, consumes roughly
4 GB of memory and can be achieved with commodity servers.
2.5 Looking glasses and RSes

The fact that network operators typically cannot see the results
of their route announcements within their own network makes de-
bugging BGP routing difﬁcult. To address this problem, the com-
munity has set up BGP looking glasses (LGes) and route monitors
(RMes) in many different locations across the Internet. LGes are
user-interfaces, co-located on routers. Many of them are publicly
accessible and can be used by anyone to execute a limited num-
ber of commands. On conventional LGes the commands include
ping, traceroute, as well as some BGP commands. The latter pro-
vides details about all BGP sessions of the router. In the past, LGes
have also been used by researchers to gain better visibility into the
AS-level topology and IXP-speciﬁc peering fabrics [28, 18].

LGes can also be co-located with RSes at IXPs. In this case, the
LGes act as proxies for executing commands against the Master
RIB of the RS and are equipped with additional capabilities that
may include commands which list (a) all preﬁxes advertised by all
peers and/or (b) the BGP attributes per preﬁx. Such LGes (referred
to as LG-RS below) are already available at some IXPs, including
DE-CIX and LonAP, and they have recently been used to explore
AS connectivity at IXPs [25].

5Also for iBGP route reﬂectors,
the advantage of using peer-
speciﬁc RIBs and independent decision processes is discussed [40].

3. DATA SOURCES

In this section, we describe the European IXPs with which we
have fruitful ongoing collaborations and that have been very forth-
coming with sharing their IXP-internal datasets with us. We pro-
vide details about these proprietary datasets as well as the public
IXP-external datasets that are at our disposal for this study.
3.1 Proﬁles of our IXPs

We focus in the following on the two IXPs (denoted L-IXP and
M-IXP) that operate a RS. These IXPs differ greatly in size (e.g.,
number of members and trafﬁc) and service offerings that they pro-
vide for their members. For comparison, Table 1 that summarizes
some key features of our IXPs and their members also includes
some basic information about our third IXP (denoted S-IXP). This
IXP is representative of the large number of smaller IXPs (i.e., less
than 20 members) that do not operate a RS. However, for the re-
mainder of this paper, we will only consider L-IXP and M-IXP and
will not use the S-IXP.

Large IXP (L-IXP): With close to 500 members and peak traf-
ﬁc that exceeded 3 Tbps in late 2013, this IXP is one of the largest
IXPs in Europe and worldwide.
It operates a layer-2 switching
fabric that is distributed over a number of colocations/datacenters
within a metropolitan area. Members can connect on ports rang-
ing from 1 to 100 Gbps. Its membership includes the full spectrum
of networks, including CDNs, content providers, hosters and the
whole range of ISPs (from Tier-1 to regional to local providers).
This IXP provides arguably one of the richest and most advanced
service offerings, including SLAs, remote peering,6 and black-holing
(mitigation of distributed denial of service attacks e.g., [8]). One of
its key service offerings is the free use of its RS. It operates two (for
redundancy) IPv4 and IPv6 RSes using a BIRD conﬁguration sim-
ilar to the one discussed in Section 2.4 with advanced LG support.

Medium IXP (M-IXP): This medium-sized IXP operates a layer-
2 switching fabric, and is present in several locations. Half of its
members are also members at the L-IXP. As of late 2013, this IXP
had 101 members and its peak trafﬁc exceeded 250 Gbps. It offers
ports ranging from 1 to 100 Gbps. Among service offerings such
as remote peering, it also offers the free use of its RS (again, two
for each IPv4 and IPv6). However, this RS does not support peer-
speciﬁc RIBs, and its LG allows the execution of only a limited set
of commands.

6The router of the “remote peer” can be located anywhere in the
world and is connected to the IXP typically via an Ethernet-over-
MPLS connection e.g., [2].

343.2

IXP-internal data: Route server

For both IXPs that operate a RS (i.e., L-IXP and M-IXP), we
have access to the data from their BIRD deployment. In the case of
L-IXP, we have weekly snapshots of the peer-speciﬁc RIBs, start-
ing in June 2013. For M-IXP, we have several snapshots of the
Master-RIB, starting in December 2013. In addition, for L-IXP,
we have all BGP trafﬁc to and from its RS that is captured on the
network interface via tcpdump.

The unique advantage of having access to these IXP-provided
control plane measurements is that they are rich enough to accu-
rately and completely reconstruct the “ground truth” in terms of
connectivity at these IXPs that has been established with the help
of the RS, i.e., the IXPs’ multi-lateral peering fabrics.
3.3

IXP-internal data: Trafﬁc

For each of our IXPs, we have access to data plane measure-
ments in the form of trafﬁc that is routinely collected from the
IXPs’ public switching infrastructures. More precisely, for each
IXP, the available datasets consist of massive amounts of sFlow
records [42], sampled from their public switching infrastructure.
The measured sFlow records contain Ethernet frame samples that
have been collected using random sampling (1 out of 16K). sFlow
captures the ﬁrst 128 bytes of each sampled frame. Thus, they con-
tain full Ethernet, network- and transport-layer headers, as well as
some bytes of payload for each sampled packet. For further de-
tails about relevant aspects of these collected sFlow records (e.g.,
absence of sampling bias, removal of irrelevant trafﬁc), see [17].

We rely on 4 continuous weeks of collected sFlow for each IXP.
For L-IXP we cover a 4-week period in August/September 2013,
and for M-IXP we cover a 4-week period in December 2013.7 In
addition, we also use snapshots collected at the L-IXP that date
back to 2011 and cover periods of two weeks.

Having access to these IXP-provided data plane measurements
makes it possible to examine the connectivity that has been estab-
lished without the use of the IXPs’ RSes (i.e., bi-lateral peerings).
However, more importantly, these measurements provide valuable
but hard-to-obtain information about how the two parties of an IXP
peering use that link and for what purpose.
3.4 Public IXP-speciﬁc data

In our work, we also rely on a number of widely-used public
datasets, including BGP data from the route collectors from RIPE
RIS, Routeviews, PCH [13], and Abilene [6]. We refer to them as
RM BGP data. Moreover, we use the data from the RS-LG at the L-
IXP in accordance with the method described in [25]. In addition,
we rely on data obtained from several publicly accessible LGes
which query the routing tables of routers that belong to members
peering at the L-IXP.

4. CONNECTIVITY: BI-/MULTI-LATERAL
Relying on our IXP-provided measurements, we show in this
section how we can get close to recovering the actual peering fab-
rics at the IXPs. We also illustrate what portions of those actual
peering fabrics can and cannot be recovered when using the differ-
ent public BGP data.

The numbers reﬂect only the well-known and easy-to-identify
networks by business type to illustrate the existence of common
members. No attempt at a complete classiﬁcation has been made.

our analysis also using only the ﬁrst week in December and got
consistent results.

4.1 Connectivity: IXP-provided data

To determine if IXP members AS X and AS Y are using a ML
peering at the IXP, we rely on the IXP-provided RS data. More
speciﬁcally, for the L-IXP, we ﬁrst check if AS X and AS Y peer
with the RS. If so, we next check in the peer-speciﬁc RIB of AS
Y for a preﬁx with AS X as next hop. If we ﬁnd such a preﬁx, we
say that AS X uses a ML peering with AS Y. If we also ﬁnd AS Y
in the peer-speciﬁc RIB of AS X as next hop, we say that the ML
peering between AS X and AS Y is symmetric or bi-directional;
otherwise, we say that the ML peering between AS X and AS Y is
asymmetric.

Given that the RS at the M-IXP only uses the Master RIB but no
peer-speciﬁc RIBs, we re-implement the per-peer export policies
based upon the Master RIB entries to determine peerings via the
RS. More speciﬁcally, if there is a route for a preﬁx in the Mas-
ter RIB with AS X as next hop, we postulate a ML peering with
all member ASes that peer with the RS, including AS Y, unless
the community values associated with the route explicitly ﬁlter the
route via the peer-speciﬁc export ﬁlter to AS Y.

To determine if IXP members AS X and AS Y are using a BL
peering at the IXP, we rely on the IXP-provided trafﬁc measure-
ments. In particular, to conclude that AS X and AS Y established
a BL peering at the IXP, we require that there are sFlow records
in the IXP-provided trafﬁc data that show that BGP data was ex-
changed between the routers of AS X and AS Y over the IXP’s
public switching infrastructure.8 We cannot however differentiate
between asymmetric and symmetric BL peerings with these data
plane measurements.

Note that our methodologies yield a lower bound for BL peerings
and an upper bound for ML peerings, but there is evidence that
these bounds are in general very tight. For example, with respect
to BL peerings, our method is not signiﬁcantly biased by the sFlow
sampling rate because the numbers are very stable once we use data
from more than two weeks. Indeed, Figure 4 shows that for the L-
IXP, the additional BL peerings seen in the third (fourth) week are
less than 1% (0.5%). As far as ML peerings are concerned, our
method does not account for the fact that some RS peers might
reject the advertisements of the RS, which can result in some over-
counting by our method. At the same time, we ﬁnd member ASes
that use one and the same link for ML as well as for BL peering.

Our best efforts to reconstruct the actual ML and BL peering
fabrics of our IXPs is summarized in Table 2. We further break

subnets of the respective IXP.

5. FROM CONNECTIVITY TO TRAFFIC

In this section, we are mainly interested in how many of the es-
tablished peerings reported in Table 2 are actually “used”; that is,
see trafﬁc. Furthermore, we are interested in the actual distribution
of trafﬁc when taking the type of the peering link into account.

down (where possible) each of the ML and BL peering fabrics into
links that are used for either IPv4 or IPv6 and in a symmetric or
asymmetric manner. For each IXP, we also tally the total number of
peerings along with the peering degree (percentage of established
peering links compared to the number of possible peering links).
4.2 Connectivity: Public BGP data

To assess the ability of the various public BGP datasets to pro-
vide visibility into the peering fabrics of our IXPs and compare
with our ﬁndings in Section 4.1 above, we ﬁrst mine the RS-LG
BGP data that has recently been considered and used in [25] and
is publicly available. The results are shown in Table 2. There are
three main take-aways. First, when restricting the study to the L-
IXP that has an RS-LG with the capabilities listed in Section 2.5,
the new methodology proposed in [25] is indeed successful in re-
covering the full-ﬂedged ML peering fabric of that IXP. Second,
as the example of the M-IXP shows, having a RS-LG that lacks
the necessary querying capabilities is of no help for inferring the
IXP’s ML peering fabric.9 Third, irrespective of the capabilities
of the RS-LG, the RS-LG BGP data cannot be used to reveal any
peerings of the L-IXP’s and M-IXP’s BL peering fabrics.

For completeness, we also obtained the number of peerings that
can be discovered from mining the traditional and widely-used RM
BGP data. The results conﬁrm past ﬁndings that a majority of the
peerings (i.e., some 70-80%) cannot be seen in those data [17, 18,
24, 41]. In addition, we also notice a signiﬁcant bias in this data to-
wards BL peerings. Interestingly, this data does produce peerings
between IXP member ASes that we do not see even in our most
complete peering fabrics discussed in Section 4.1. One possible
explanation for seeing such peerings in the public but not in the
IXP-provided BGP data is that the member ASes in question en-
gage in private peering at the IXP10 or peer in a different location.
Summary
We observe a dense peering mesh at our IXPs, with ML peerings
outnumbering BL peerings by a ratio of 4:1 and 8:1 at the L-IXP
and the M-IXP respectively. Thus, connectivity at these IXPs is
clearly driven by their RSes and the resulting ML peerings. For
IPv6 connectivity we note that at both IXPs, the number of IPv6
peerings is roughly half of the number of IPv4 peerings. LGes
co-located with IXP RSes are able to uncover the full ML peering
fabric, assuming they support an advanced set of commands. BL

9Some portion of the ML peering fabric may be recovered but only
with substantial additional efforts. For example, by using preﬁxes
extracted from the RIPE RIS or Routeviews data, a portion of the
IPv4 preﬁxes on the Master RIB of the M-IXP can be recovered
and used to submit queries to this RS-LG.
10Private peerings at IXPs are handled completely separate from the
IXP’s public switching infrastructure and are not part of our study.

To identify a trafﬁc-carrying peering between AS X and AS Y,
we look for sFlow records that (i) contain MAC addresses which
belong to AS X and AS Y, respectively, and (ii) have IP addresses
that are not part of the IP address space assigned to the IXP. Thus,
we only count the exchange of non-local IP trafﬁc, which allows
us to clearly separate control trafﬁc (i.e., BGP sessions) and actual
data trafﬁc, thus we can distinguish between BL peerings with and
without trafﬁc. Once we identiﬁed a trafﬁc-carrying peering link,
we assign it to be either BL or ML, depending on our earlier intro-
duced inference. For a small portion of the trafﬁc (less than 0.5%
for both IXPs) we did not ﬁnd a corresponding BL or ML peering
link. We discard this trafﬁc from our analysis.11

In this context, for IXP member ASes that peer with other mem-
ber ASes at the IXP both bi-laterally and multi-laterally, we are
faced with the problem of determining whether the observed trafﬁc
between two such ASes is traversing the BL or ML peering link
between them; that is, identifying the trafﬁc-carrying peering(s).
Taking a pragmatic approach, when two IXP member ASes peer
with one another at the IXP both bi-laterally and multi-laterally,
we tag the BL peering between them as the trafﬁc-carrying peering
and associate any observed trafﬁc with it. Intuitively, our argument
for this approach is based on the observation that compared to ML
peering, establishing a BL peering requires work (e.g., manually
setting up BGP sessions) and is an indication of joint incentives
and needs between the involved parties. On the other hand, peering
multi-laterally at the IXP (i.e., using the RS) is designed to be easy
and informal, making it in general possible to exchange trafﬁc with
all the RS’s peers from the get-go.

To provide empirical support for our argument, we manually
searched for LGes that query the routing tables of member routers
that peer both bi-laterally and multi-laterally with other members.
We found six such LGes with sufﬁcient capabilities to reason about
the best path selected. In all cases, advertisements via BL sessions
were selected as best path over advertisements from the RS.12
5.2 Trafﬁc over ML and BL peerings

The results of our analysis of the trafﬁc-carrying links are sum-
marized in Table 3. When compared to Table 2, the ﬁrst column
in Table 3 shows that most peering links (i.e., more than 80% at
both IXPs) are actually “used” in the sense of the binary attribute
“carry trafﬁc/no trafﬁc”. Moreover, we note that the ratio of trafﬁc-
carrying peerings is largest for BL peerings, followed by symmetric
ML peering, followed by asymmetric ML peering.

Moving beyond this binary classiﬁcation of peering links, this
usage picture sharpens when examining the second column of Ta-
ble 3. This column shows for each IXP the number of peerings
that are responsible for 99.9% of the IXP’s total trafﬁc; that is, all
11Possible explanations for this trafﬁc are either non-detected BGP
sessions or peerings using protocols other than BGP (e.g., static
routing).
12Selection of BL over ML was typically done by setting the local
preference to a higher value for routes received via BL sessions.
However, we point out that is not necessarily true for all peerings.

peerings that collectively see less than 0.1% of the overall trafﬁc
are discarded.13 When imposing such thresholds to eliminate peer-
ings that carry only comparably little amounts of trafﬁc, we ob-
serve a drastic reduction of the number of active peerings. Indeed,
the main take-away from this thresholding exercise is that it puts
the connectivity-related ﬁndings reported in Section 4.2 into proper
perspective. Speciﬁcally, it demonstrates that while RSes increase
connectivity and are responsible for the larger part of peerings, a
majority of those ML peerings typically does not carry much traf-
ﬁc. At the same time, the smaller number of BL peerings that are
established at IXPs carry in general the bulk of the trafﬁc.

As a by-product of this thresholding, we also notice that essen-
tially none of the large number of IPv6 peerings that have been
established at our IXPs carry any signiﬁcant trafﬁc. Thus, while
connectivity for IPv6 is there, trafﬁc still ranges in the order of less
than 1% at each of our IXPs. As a result, for the remainder of this
paper, we will focus exclusively on IPv4 trafﬁc that traverses the
IXPs’ switching infrastructures. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to
mention that some links are only present for IPv6 but not for IPv4.
To assess the overall contribution of BL and ML peerings, we
map the total trafﬁc of the L-IXP and M-IXP onto the BL and ML
peerings that have been established at each of these IXPs. Fig-
ure 5(a) shows a time series for the trafﬁc on BL and ML peerings
at both IXPs over a one-week period. We observe that even though
there are much fewer BL peerings than ML peerings at L-IXP, the
total amount of BL trafﬁc is more than twice the total amount of
ML trafﬁc. To contrast, for M-IXP, this BL:ML trafﬁc ratio is more
like 1:1.

Even though this trafﬁc-centric picture of IXP peerings empha-
sizes the signiﬁcance of BL peerings, ML peerings do play an im-
portant role. Figure 5(b) shows a CCDF of the distribution of traf-
ﬁc over BL/ML peerings. As far as the top trafﬁc-contributing
peerings are concerned, BL and ML peerings contribute similar
amounts of trafﬁc. In fact, for both the L-IXP and the M-IXP, the
top trafﬁc-contributing peering is a ML peering which highlights
the critical role that the use of IXP RSes play in today’s Internet.
Summary
While most peerings at our IXPs (e.g., some 80%) do carry trafﬁc,
BL peerings are more likely to carry trafﬁc when compared to ML
peerings. Taking trafﬁc volumes into account, the small number
of BL peerings clearly dominate the large number of ML peerings,
with observed trafﬁc ratios of 2:1 (L-IXP) and 1:1 (M-IXP). Thus,
the majority of ML peerings only carry small amounts of trafﬁc,

13Note that the corresponding thresholds still require a monthly traf-
ﬁc volume of some tens resp. hundreds of GBs at each IXP.

6. FROM TRAFFIC TO ROUTES: PREFIXES

In this section, we move beyond the link perspective of peer-
ings and peering trafﬁc and instead examine peerings at the level
of routed preﬁxes. We show how this new perspective allows us to
reason about peering opportunities at IXPs and the different peer-
ing options chosen by member ASes.
6.1 A preﬁx view of peering

An outward sign of the popularity of the RS service offering with
the member ASes of the L-IXP and M-IXP is the large number of
ML peerings that have been established at those IXPs. To further
understand what set of routes RSes at popular IXPs offer – e.g.,
to understand the instant beneﬁts that a new member AS can reap
when connecting to the IXP’s RS – we check each preﬁx that is
advertised via the RS and count to how many of the RS’s peers this
preﬁx is exported. For the L-IXP, Figure 6(a) shows the resulting
histogram (y-axis in log-scale) and reveals a striking bi-modality
– either a preﬁx is exported to almost all members or to only a
few selected ones. Focusing on the mode to the right, the sizable
fraction of preﬁxes that is exported to almost all member ASes is a
reﬂection of the very peering-friendly policies at the IXP. Summing
up all the preﬁxes that are exported by the RS to more than 90% of
its peers shows that a new IXP member will receive more than 65K
routes from some 11K different origin ASes at the L-IXP and more
than 12.5K routes from about 3K different origin ASes at the M-
IXP (see Table 4) once connected to the RS.

As far as the mode to the left in Figure 6(a) is concerned, the siz-
able fraction of preﬁxes that are exported to fewer than 10% of the
RS’s peers is an indication that the strategy offered by the IXPs to
restrict (block) the propagation of certain routes to certain members
is effective and used. Upon closer inspection, we also observe that

the sets of reachable origin ASes for the mode to the left and mode
to the right are largely disjoint. For M-IXP (not shown), we note
that while the number of advertised preﬁxes and the correspond-
ing reachable address space is much smaller, the vast majority of
preﬁxes are exported to almost all peers.

To illustrate, of the 408 member ASes that connect to the L-
IXP RS, we ﬁnd that only some 24 limit the export of some or all
of their preﬁxes. However, 371 members export their preﬁxes to
more than 90% of the members participating in the RS. At M-IXP,
we see an even more peering-friendly environment with only very
few members applying strict export ﬁltering for a small number of
preﬁxes.
6.2 A preﬁx view of trafﬁc

To complement the connectivity-centric preﬁx-level, we are now
interested in how this corresponds to actual trafﬁc exchanged. By
matching all destination IP addresses of trafﬁc exchanged (irrespec-
tive of the link type) on the aggregate of RS preﬁxes, we see that
more than 80% of the overall trafﬁc at L-IXP (95% at M-IXP) is
sent towards RS preﬁxes. Hence, the preﬁxes advertised at RSes
give signiﬁcant insight into spatial aspects of its actual trafﬁc com-
ponents.

In view of Figure 6(a), we are especially curious about how much
trafﬁc is related to those preﬁxes that are exported to almost every
peer of the RS and to those that are exported to only a few se-
lected peers of the RS. We compute the percentage of trafﬁc that
each preﬁx at the RS is responsible for and plot in Figure 6(b) their
sum as a function of the number of the RS’s peers to which the RS
exported the preﬁx. While we observe a similar bi-modality as in
Figure 6(a), the openly-advertised preﬁxes are responsible for the

largest trafﬁc share. While the percentage of trafﬁc covered by the
very selectively-advertised preﬁxes (exported to less than 10% of
the member ASes using the RS) is about 9% of all trafﬁc, the more
openly-advertised preﬁxes (exported to more than 90% of the mem-
ber ASes using the RS) cover the destination addresses of almost
70% of all exchanged trafﬁc in terms of bytes.
6.3 A closer look at RS usage

To this point, we have mainly focused on the overall trafﬁc at
the IXPs and how it relates to the preﬁxes that are advertised via
the IXP’s RS. In particular, we have paid little attention to the per-
member AS policies that determine which ASes advertise their pre-
ﬁxes to which other ASes and over what kind of IXP peering. On
the one hand, a majority of members openly advertise their preﬁxes
via the RS, and these preﬁxes cover a majority of the IXP trafﬁc. At
the same time, we see the bulk of trafﬁc traversing BL links. Thus,
we would like to know if members advertise different preﬁxes to
the IXP’s RS and over their BL peering session, i.e., what is the
overlap in terms of routes advertised via both sessions.

The problem we face is that while we know the route set adver-
tised over ML peerings, we only have binary information about the
existence of BL peerings (i.e., we sampled BGP packets indicating
an active BL session). To deal with this issue, we rely on properties
of the actual trafﬁc exchanged between members. In particular, we
check for each IXP member if the trafﬁc it receives is fully cov-
ered by the preﬁxes advertised via the RS or if there is trafﬁc to a
superset of RS preﬁxes. More precisely, to obtain Figure 7(a), we
compute for each member AS of the L-IXP (x-axis) which fraction
of the trafﬁc sent to this member is (i) covered by the preﬁxes that

38this speciﬁc member advertises via the IXP’s RS (shown in upper
half of the plot) and (ii) not covered by the preﬁxes this member
advertises to the RS (see lower part of the plot). Before plotting
these values, we sort them in increasing order, starting with those
members for which none of their trafﬁc is covered by the RS pre-
ﬁxes. To minimize the impact of churn (new route advertisements,
route withdrawals), we use one week of trafﬁc, starting on the same
day for which we have the corresponding RS dump.
Figure 7(a) shows that for the majority of members (to the right
of x ≈ 120), all trafﬁc they receive is covered by the preﬁxes they
advertise via the RS; that is, there is no trafﬁc at the IXP destined to
any addresses outside these preﬁxes – for these members, the RS is
all there is! For another set of members (to the left of x ≈ 85), we
see that none of the trafﬁc they receive is covered by the RS preﬁxes
advertised by them. These members either do not connect to the RS
at all or do not advertise any preﬁxes via the RS. Finally, there is a
small group of member ASes in the middle (around x = 100) that
use preﬁxes that they advertise via the RS as well as preﬁxes that
they do not advertise via the RS. We discuss these cases in more
detail in Section 8.2. In terms of numbers, about 67% of all trafﬁc
is sent to members on the right part of this ﬁgure and roughly 26%
of the trafﬁc is destined to the members in the cluster on the left.
The members in the middle-section receive about 7% of all trafﬁc
– a signiﬁcant share given the small number of members in the
middle-section. For M-IXP, the members in the right part account
for more than 95% of the trafﬁc.

Figure 7 uses grey-shading to indicate which portion of a mem-
ber’s trafﬁc is associated with BL or ML peerings. For example,
the members that only peer bi-laterally are all black (the few ex-
ceptions are due to churn in route advertisements). Member ASes
that only peer multi-laterally are all grey. In addition, some mem-
bers are highlighted in terms of their main business type, and we
will return to this cast of players in Section 8 below. Together, Fig-
ures 7(a) and 7(b) show that while most member ASes use BL and
ML peerings, the majority of members only receive trafﬁc for those
preﬁxes that they also advertise via the RS. Thus, the need to ad-
vertise a different route set bi-laterally and multi-laterally can — in
most cases — be ruled out as the reason for two member ASes to
peer both bi-laterally and multi-laterally with each other at an IXP
(following up on the discussion in Section 5.1). Instead, the rea-
sons are more likely a question of control and trust (see discussion
in Section 9.3), but more mundane reasons such as the ease with
which ML peerings can be established and the lack of incentives to
remove/block preﬁx advertisements via the RS once a BL peering
has been established might also play a role.
Summary
Our IXP RSes provide access to a signiﬁcant portion of the Inter-
net’s routes and networks and most member ASes provide open
access to their RS-preﬁxes to all IXP RS participants. The routes
advertised openly via the RS are indeed routes to popular destina-
tions and they receive a majority of the trafﬁc at both IXPs. In turn,
the route set of an IXP RS is a good approximation of the popular
destinations as seen from this IXP. Individual member ASes typi-
cally exhibit a binary behavior: either all routes for which trafﬁc
is received are advertised via the RS or none at all. Many member
ASes that openly advertise their preﬁxes via the RS also establish
BL sessions to selected other members ASes - without advertising a
superset of preﬁxes on these sessions. This observation agrees with
publicly-stated peering policies from large content providers (see,
e.g., Google [5]), which state that BL peerings can be established
once a signiﬁcant amount of trafﬁc is exchanged. We also see cases
in which member ASes advertise a different route set on BL peer-

7. CHANGE CHANGES THINGS

With our IXP datasets, we are observing an Internet peering
ecosystem in ﬂux. With more IXPs operating RSes, more mem-
bers peer multi-laterally and connect to more than one IXP. In this
section, we examine in more detail how IXP peerings at the L-IXP
change over time and how the common members at the L-IXP and
the M-IXP use those IXPs.
7.1 Same IXP: IXP peerings over time

Taking advantage of our historical collection of sFlow records
from L-IXP, we perform a longitudinal study of the IXP peerings
at this IXP. To examine the relationship between BL and ML peer-
ings during the last 2+ years, we focus on the trafﬁc-carrying peer-
ings and rely on the methodology described in the latter part of
Section 4.1 to infer BL peerings. The results are depicted in Fig-
ure 8 and illustrate that while the total number of observed trafﬁc-
carrying links has increased noticeably during this time period, the
number of BL peerings has only increased slightly. Thus, the ob-
served increase in the number of trafﬁc-carrying peerings is mainly
due to the proliferation of ML peerings. Taking into account our
earlier observation that only about 85% (24%) of symmetric (asym-
metric) ML peerings do carry actual trafﬁc, we can conclude that
the number of established ML peerings exceeds the number of trafﬁc-
carrying ML peerings by some 5-10k links. At the same time, we
ﬁnd that the ratio of total BL peering trafﬁc to total ML peering traf-
ﬁc has stayed constant at around 65–67% (not shown), a reminder
that from a trafﬁc perspective one has to consider both types of
peerings.

To examine in more detail the dynamics of peerings over time,
we consider next ﬁve different two-week snapshots of sFlow data,
dating back to 2011. For each snapshot, we identify the trafﬁc-
carrying BL peerings and tag the remaining trafﬁc-carrying links as

that while the member ASes at M-IXP use predominantly ML peer-
ings, it is more often the case that the member ASes use BL peering
at the L-IXP. In fact, the BL peerings common to both IXPs make
up almost half of all trafﬁc-carrying BL peerings at M-IXP.

To illustrate the common members’ contributions to the trafﬁc
volume at the two IXPs, Figure 10 shows for all common member
ASes that exchange trafﬁc at the two IXPs how their normalized
trafﬁc shares compare. The scatter-plot shows for each common
member AS the fraction of its trafﬁc at the L-IXP (x-axis) vs. the
fraction of its trafﬁc at the M-IXP, where we normalize by all traf-
ﬁc over the common peerings. The observed clustering around the
diagonal is an indication that the common member ASes’ (rela-
tive) contributions to the respective overall peering trafﬁc at the
two IXPs are similar. A similar strong clustering can also be seen
when examining the common members’ contributions at the level
of common peering links (not shown).

The overall picture that emerges from studying the common mem-
ber ASes at the two IXPs and how they use the different IXPs is
consistent with their proﬁles (see Section 3). For example, the ASes
in the upper right corner of Figure 10 are the well-known big con-
tent providers/CDNs and make extensive use of both IXPs – they
use the L-IXP because of its global role as a critical hub in today’s
Internet, and they are at M-IXP because of its mainly regional role
as a place for small-medium eyeball networks to connect. On the
other hand, the few outliers in Figure 10 (e.g., point in upper left
and points in lower right) are typically smaller regional networks
that prefer one IXP over the other for reasons such as location,
reach, and needs. In addition, for the latter to establish connec-
tivity at the two IXPs via the IXPs’ RSes is very low overhead and
justiﬁes membership at the IXPs, irrespective of any imminent need
to exchange trafﬁc.
Summary
Our longitudinal analysis of the L-IXP shows that while its RS is
clearly the main driver for increasing connectivity among member
ASes at this IXP, the trafﬁc ratio between BL and ML peering stays
largely constant, with BL peerings accounting for twice as much
trafﬁc. Switch-overs from ML to BL peering typically occur when
there is an increase of trafﬁc carried over that link. For ASes that
are members at two IXPs, we observe that peering links with other
networks are largely consistent across the different IXPs. We also
notice that the relative trafﬁc contributions of members peering at
our two IXPs exhibit strong correlations. This is also the case for
common trafﬁc-carrying peerings between the same ASes across
IXPs.

ML peerings. Then we check if the same trafﬁc-carrying peerings
that are present in two consecutive snapshots have changed their
peering type or not (see Table 5). Although some small amount
of churn could result from our inability to detect all BL sessions
in a given snapshot (see Section 4.1), we observe that the number
of changes from ML-to-BL and BL-to-ML, respectively, are rela-
tively stable. The churn caused by ML peerings being replaced by
BL peerings is consistently higher than the churn that is due to the
peering types changing from BL to ML. We also notice that the
trafﬁc volume on these peerings increases substantially if the type
changes from ML to BL. In contrast, a peering type change from
BL to ML typically goes along with a signiﬁcant decrease in the
amount of trafﬁc that gets exchanged. These observations support
the argument that BL peerings are typically established and used if
there is signiﬁcant trafﬁc volume that may or may not need addi-
tional BGP capabilities (see e.g., [5]). Another reason for encoun-
tering more ML-to-BL than BL-to-ML changes is that when new
members join an IXP, they typically start with ML peerings and
may switch later on to BL peerings with a subset of IXP member
ASes.
7.2 Different IXPs: Common members

We next perform a comparative analysis and check how networks
make use of the two IXPs that cover by and large the same geo-
graphic region. The two IXPs have 50 members in common (see
Table 1). Figure 9 summarizes the results of our comparison with
respect to connectivity (i.e., peerings and peering type) and trafﬁc.
Of these 50 common ASes, more than 75% use consistent peering
setups in the sense that if they are peering/not peering with one
another at one IXP, they also do so at the other IXP. At the same
time, more than 20% do peer at one IXP but not at the other IXP.
However, not all of these peerings see trafﬁc, and the percentages
of trafﬁc-carrying peerings are reported in the second sub-table of
Figure 9. As far a the types of these trafﬁc-carrying peerings are
concerned, we observe that in 46% of the cases ML peering is used
at both locations and BL peering in 28% of the cases. This observa-
tion is consistent with the overall picture (not presented) and shows

8. CASE STUDIES

In this section, we take a closer look at some of the well-known
major players in today’s Internet that send signiﬁcant trafﬁc over
the public switching fabrics of either L-IXP or M-IXP. We are in-
terested in understanding how they make use of these IXPs so that
we can reason about their choices of peering options, and assess
whether there are typical patterns for ASes of the same business
type.

8.1 Our cast of big players

Our selection of “big players” was driven by the volume of traf-
ﬁc they exchange at L-IXP or M-IXP, by the type of businesses
they represent, and by their geographic reach. To this end, we
chose two ASes that are responsible for a signiﬁcant share of con-
tent in today’s Internet and are among the top trafﬁc contributors
at both IXPs where each of their trafﬁc share is over 10% (C1 and
C2). Moreover, we picked two popular Online Social Networks
(OSN) that use the IXPs extensively (OSN1 and OSN2), two re-
gional eyeball providers (EYE2 and EYE1), and two Tier-1s (T1-1
and T1-2).

There are two basic observations from our characterization work
described in the previous sections. First, the big content providers
and the regional eyeball networks are actively using the IXPs’ RSes
and peer openly, most likely to reduce transit cost and reduce la-
tency. On the other hand, the Tier-1s which include some of the
major eyeball networks with presence in Europe and overseas peer
more restrictively and often do not use the RS. Our ﬁndings about
the selected players are summarized in Table 6 and show some un-
expected yet important differences.

In the case of the two major content providers, we note that C1
exchanges most of its trafﬁc via BL peerings. However, this con-
tent provider actively markets the RS connectivity and maintains
many ML peering sessions. On the other hand, C2 exchanges more
than half of its trafﬁc via the ML peerings and we notice an in-
creasing tendency towards ML peerings for this player over the last
two years. In both cases, their preﬁxes are openly advertised to all
members and we see 100% resp. 99% of the trafﬁc sent towards
these members covered by the preﬁxes they advertise via the RS.

When examining the two OSNs, the most striking ﬁnding is that
they approach peering completely different, choosing the two ex-
tremes of the spectrum of available peering options. On the one
hand, OSN1 only offers BL peering and is not present at the IXPs’
RS. A likely reason is that this OSN wants to have control over its
trafﬁc ﬂows. On the other hand, OSN2 only does ML peering at
IXPs like L-IXP that are outside of this OSN’s home country. In
fact, their publicly announced peering policy states that they try to
avoid BL BGP sessions wherever peering using a RS is possible. A

plausible reason to choose this option is to reduce the administra-
tive overhead associated with BL peering.

As for the Tier-1s, in contrast to the US where Tier-1s typically
do not use the IXPs’ public switching fabrics, many Tier-1s connect
at L-IXP, including our players T1-1 and T1-2. One of them
also connects at M-IXP. Focusing on our two Tier-1s, they all use
a selective peering policy which is often interpreted to mean that
they do not use the RS. While this is true for most of them, we see
some exceptions. T1-1, for example, does indeed not use the RS
at all at either of the IXPs. While T1-2 connects to the L-IXP RS,
it tags all of its routes with the NO-EXPORT community which
implies that none of them are shared with any of the other ASes
that are at the RS. Thus, this Tier-1 also solely relies on bi-lateral
connections. The reason for its presence at the RS is unclear to us
but might be a hint towards early exploration of RS usage.

The regional eyeball providers, EYE1 and EYE2 both peer openly
utilizing the RS at both IXPs. We see all of the trafﬁc sent to these
members covered by their RS preﬁxes. While we notice a tendency
towards more ML peerings at the M-IXP vs. the L-IXP, both eye-
ball networks also use BL peerings, with EYE2 relying mostly on
BL sessions.
8.2 Players with hybrid peerings

Figure 7 (left lower part) clearly shows that some members only
peer bi-laterally at L-IXP or M-IXP. The other large group of mem-
bers consists of those that advertise all preﬁxes for which they re-
ceive trafﬁc via the RS but receive varying amounts of trafﬁc via
BL peerings. However, the more intriguing cases are those mem-
bers that occupy the small middle part in Figure 7 (e.g., around
x = 100) and advertise some preﬁxes via the RS, but receive traf-
ﬁc for a superset of these preﬁxes. While this fraction of members
is rather small compared to the overall number of members, we see
some important players here, carrying signiﬁcant trafﬁc volumes.
We select two cases, namely CDN, a mid-sized content delivery net-
work and NSP, a large transit provider. We have seen that content
providers typically advertise their preﬁxes openly and large tran-
sit providers advertise them more selectively. CDN and NSP differ
from these typical cases by following a “hybrid” peering strategy
by advertising some preﬁxes multi-laterally, some others only bi-
laterally to selected member ASes.

In the case of CDN, we ﬁnd that close to 90% of its incoming
trafﬁc is covered by the small number of openly advertised RS pre-
ﬁxes. However, this AS also has some 59 BL peering links, and
on most of them we see trafﬁc to a superset of the preﬁxes adver-
tised via the RS.14 We assume that this is as an example of complex
trafﬁc engineering performed by today’s CDNs that, in this case,
involves both using the vast connectivity provided by the RS, as
well as the application of more ﬁne-granular preﬁx advertisements
for speciﬁc networks, e.g., to fulﬁll performance requirements for
certain customers.

NSP advertises some 5K preﬁxes openly via the RS, and most
of them contain subsequent ASNs in the AS path that are not other
ASNs of the NSP. Nevertheless, most trafﬁc is exchanged via BL
peering sessions and only about 20% of NSP’s incoming trafﬁc is
covered by its RS preﬁxes. While at L-IXP, NSP receives traf-
ﬁc from most members ASes, many of them peer bi-laterally with
NSP and some of them send trafﬁc to a large superset of the preﬁxes
advertised via the RS. Interestingly, we see a very similar pattern
for NSP also at M-IXP where it receives about 45% of its trafﬁc
for preﬁxes advertised via the RS and the other part for a super-

14We veriﬁed that a superset of preﬁxes is advertised on these ses-
sions by using the LGes of IXP members. Moreover we note that
the corresponding paths were prepended.

41set. Again, we validated the advertisement of a superset of preﬁxes
using LGes of IXP members having BL sessions with NSP. We
assume that NSP’s hybrid approach to peering is in support of its
main business (e.g., transit provider), and hints towards growing di-
versiﬁcation of models in the transit business (see e.g., [35], [23]).
We note that NSP is present at many IXPs and thus might have
more conﬁdence and experience in making use of RS functionality,
tailored to its business interests, than other transit providers.
Summary
Among the networks that have an open peering policy and utilize
IXP RSes, we observe a diverse set of players ranging from content
providers to eyeball networks. While many networks that utilize the
RS also rely on additional BL peerings, some only use the RS (i.e.,
no BL peerings) and others (particularly larger transit networks)
typically do not use RSes at all. We also observe networks with
hybrid peering strategies in the sense that they advertise parts of
their routes via the RS and others via BL peerings, hinting towards
advanced usage of RSes.

9. DISCUSSION

Our empirical study of real-world IXP RS deployments and how
IXP RSes are being used by a wide range of today’s Internet play-
ers has implications for IXP and network operators as well as re-
searchers.
9.1 On the beneﬁts of connecting to an IXP

The success of the large European IXPs is an example of a (pos-
itive) network effect “in action.” As these IXPs have been grow-
ing in size, their value for each of their members has increased,
but managing and maintaining the ensuing bi-lateral peerings (i.e.,
large number of corresponding BGP sessions) has became a bur-
den for many of these members. To alleviate this burden, these
IXPs have started to offer their members the free use of their route
servers, and this service has contributed to making those IXPs even
more attractive to yet more networks.

To quantify this attractiveness, our empirical results suggest a
concrete step that IXPs and network operators could take for effec-
tively evaluating the instant beneﬁts that a network can reap when
connecting (either directly or remotely) to an IXP. In particular, we
have seen that at our two IXPs, where a majority of the members
connect to the RS (i.e., more than 80% of the L-IXP’s members and
more than 90% of the M-IXP’s members), the preﬁxes advertised
by each of the two IXPs’ RSes cover some 80-95% of all trafﬁc
seen and include many of the most popular destinations. Thus,
if IXPs provide the proﬁle of routes that are advertised via their
RSes (e.g., via adequately-supported LGes), network operators can
immediately determine how much of their individual trafﬁc would
reach these destinations from “day one” (i.e., as soon as they start
connecting to the IXP’s RS). They can then compare the different
available interconnection options in terms of costs, performance
or other criteria to make an informed decision about which IXP(s)
they want to connect to and how they want to make use of the IXP’s
RS (see Section 8).

Although we lack comparable data from the other large Euro-
pean IXPs that operate a RS, the fact that a majority of their mem-
bers connect to the RS (e.g., some 70% at LINX, over 80% at
AMS-IX) suggests that their RSes cover a similarly large portion
of trafﬁc seen at those IXPs as observed at the L-IXP and M-IXP.
However, we caution against generalizing our RS-speciﬁc observa-
tions across the spectrum of IXPs worldwide. For example, even
in Europe there are large regional IXPs (e.g., NL-IX) where the re-
ported member participation at the RS is less than 50%. Looking

beyond Europe, while many of the larger IXPs in North America
operate a RS (e.g., Equinix, Any2), little is known about member
participation in the RS15 and typically no information is available
about the portion of trafﬁc covered by such an IXP’s RS.
9.2 A peering ecosystem in ﬂux

Our ﬁndings show that the popularity of the IXPs’ RSes has led
to a proliferation of ML peerings, but at this point, a majority of the
trafﬁc that is exchanged at a typical IXP is still exchanged via BL
peerings. However, as more networks explore how to best use their
many easy-to-establish and simple-to-maintain ML peerings (e.g.,
as back-up, as primary connection, only for certain trafﬁc or partic-
ular peers) and try to incorporate them into their complex peering
decision making processes, the current picture is bound to undergo
constant changes, especially if the IXPs keep on innovating and
improving RS functionalities and operations. Thus, new research
efforts are required for developing and deploying appropriate mon-
itoring infrastructures that yield reliable data for sensing the onset
of possible “sea changes” in the future Internet peering ecosystem
and also providing insight into the reasons for their occurrence.

In this context, although the IXP-provided data used in this study
is proprietary, we show in Section 4 how it can be put to good use by
increasing the value of certain publicly available datasets for future
studies by other researchers. For example, proprietary data often
enables a direct comparison between inferred connections (based
on publicly available information) and actual connections (based
on proprietary information), and we illustrate this capability in this
paper by calibrating the quality of the BGP measurements that are
becoming publicly available from RS-LGes in selective IXPs.

The use of such vetted public data would be of particular inter-
est in the context of monitoring the impact (or lack thereof) of the
recently launched Open IX (OIX) initiative [11]. This initiative’s
main objective is to bring more peering opportunities to the US
interconnection marketplace that has historically been dominated
by an inordinately small number of players whose main focus has
been on private peering offerings (i.e., cross connects). As a result
of this situation, prices for cross connects in the major metropolitan
areas in the US are about six times as high as in the major Euro-
pean cities, where peering opportunities are abundant, especially
in places with highly successful IXPs. Among the early develop-
ments related to the OIX initiative that was launched less than a
year ago are the establishment of new European-style IXPs in the
USA by the largest European IXPs (e.g., LINX in Northern Vir-
ginia [9], AMS-IX and DE-CIX in New York [1, 3]) and a formal
certiﬁcation process whereby the certiﬁed commercial data center
and colocation provider companies explicitly agree to house certi-
ﬁed IXPs in their facilities. Only time will tell if these early devel-
opments will bring about the “sea change” within the US peering
ecosystem that the supporters of OIX are advocating, but our ﬁnd-
ings point to concrete data collection efforts that should be pursued
to assess the actual impact of OIX in the US (e.g., encouraging the
deployment of RS-LGes by the IXPs in the US and the continuous
data collection from these emerging new vantage points).
9.3
Innovation in inter-domain routing

Based on our description of today’s RSes, their popularity is un-
derstandable because establishing connectivity in the control plane
via a RS is simple (i.e., requiring basically one BGP session setup),
efﬁcient (in terms of receiving routes to a signiﬁcant part of the In-
ternet), and quick (i.e., an ability to start exchanging trafﬁc from the
15A noteworthy exception is SIX in Seattle, which started offer-
ing RS services in 2014 and provides a Looking Glass showing
all members connecting to the RS and their advertised routes.

42get-go). In this sense, the relatively recent RS offerings by IXPs can
be viewed as a concrete example of an innovation in inter-domain
routing, an area that is notorious for resisting changes to or deploy-
ing improvements over the status quo (i.e., BGP).

More importantly, our discussions of the design and operations
of today’s IXP RSes show that they do not forward any data trafﬁc
and adhere to a strict separation of control plane and data plane.
This observation makes RS design and operations a prime candi-
date for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN) which, in turn, sug-
gests that IXPs are natural places for harnessing SDN’s power to
improve if not revolutionize inter-domain routing. In fact, the con-
cept of a software deﬁned Internet exchange (SDX) is the topic of a
recent paper [27] in which the authors consider novel approaches to
innovation at the IXP RSes, including software support for a range
of policies for inter-domain trafﬁc engineering with BGP that are
either difﬁcult to perform using current RS capabilities or simply
out of reach for today’s RS implementations.

In fact, by describing how RSes are used in practice, our work
is complementary to [27] and raises a number of questions that are
mainly concerned with issues such as ﬂexibility, trust, and security.
Addressing these and related issues as part of the SDX effort would
have far-reaching implications, mainly because they have prevented
some of the larger players to rely and depend on the IXPs’ RSes.
For example, member ASes that want to control which preﬁxes are
advertised to which other member ASes typically have the BGP
know-how to peer bi-laterally to achieve the desired control over
the trafﬁc they receive. While the use of the RS does not preclude
such control, peering bi-laterally offers a member AS additional
opportunities for BGP trafﬁc engineering, e.g., AS-path prepend-
ing, MED, scoped advertisements [39] etc., that are currently not
fully supported by RSes. More generally, how to expand the effort
described in [27] to also include bi-lateral peering as part of the
proposed SDX approach looms as an interesting open problem.

With respect to trust-related issues, IXP operators are aware of
concerns that some of their member ASes have about RS avail-
ability, RS operations, RS monitoring/debugging capabilities, and
security at the RS.16 For example, there currently exist no SLAs
for the RS itself, but most of the IXPs operate redundant RSes.17
From an operational perspective, there are numerous opportunities
for misconﬁgurations at the RS (e.g., ﬁlter setup, mis-shapes with
routing registries), and the monitoring capabilities at today’s RSes
are still in their infancy. In terms of security, an RS adds an ad-
ditional middleman that has to be trusted with the proper handling
of all route advertisements. In this context, large IXPs may be op-
portune places for future deployment of BGP security mechanisms
such as sBGP [37].

10. CONCLUSION

Using a collection of IXP-provided datasets that offer unprece-
dented visibility into the control plane (i.e., BGP data from the RS)
and data plane (i.e., sFlow measurements) as seen at two Euro-
pean IXPs, we report in this paper on an in-depth study of IXP
RSes for the purpose of understanding an IXP’s full-ﬂedged public
peering fabric; that is, the existence of peerings (i.e., connectiv-
ity) as well as their usage (i.e., trafﬁc) and how they are used by
which player and for what reasons. In the process, we obtain an
accurate picture of the relative importance of ML peerings (large
in numbers, but responsible for only a minority of the trafﬁc) vs.
BL peerings (small in numbers, but carrying the bulk of the trafﬁc).
More importantly, when moving beyond the traditional link-level

perspective of peering and examining the correlation between the
control and data plane views at the preﬁx-level, reasoning about
which ASes peer with which other networks (e.g., how and for what
reasons) becomes feasible. This, in turn, leads to new insight into
how the IXPs’ RSes are used by their member ASes and demon-
strates that these RSes are quickly becoming critical enablers for
connectivity and, as a result, integral entities of today’s Internet
inter-domain routing system that deserve the full attention of net-
working researchers.
