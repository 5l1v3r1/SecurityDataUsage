ABSTRACT
Users on today’s Internet are subjected to a barrage of
advertising and privacy concerning practices. However
there is a gap in understanding the treatment of not-
logged-in and logged-in users on websites. To address
this gap in understanding, we create accounts and crawl
345 popular websites from 14 Alexa website categories
while both not-logged-in and logged-in to determine –
for the ﬁrst time – how users are treated when logged-in
versus not-logged-in with respect to the types and rate
of ads and privacy concerns. We establish that logged-in
users are treated to more ads and more privacy concerns
on average and the website category greatly impacts
the amount of ads/concerns users are subjected to. We
also note that 42% of websites crawled leaked PII and
identify that age/gender/zipcode are more valued than
user/ﬁrst/last name personal information. Finally, we
observe that 463 unique third parties received at least
one piece of PII, indicating that user PII is leaked more
aggressively than previously known.

INTRODUCTION

Users of today’s Internet are frequently subjected to
a barrage of advertisements and tracking scripts. This
barrage hurts the browsing experience, resulting in the
proliferation of ad blockers by users to reclaim it [6].
The measurement community has also noticed these
issues from a variety of perspectives: user-experience,
privacy risks, and advertising saturation. However, a
gap exists in understanding how websites treat logged-in
users compared to not-logged-in users. This distinction
matters, as logged-in users are subjected to two poten-
tial information leakage vectors: personally identiﬁable

information (PII) they provide to websites and machine-
based information that can be extracted about a user’s
device. For not-logged-in users, only the machine-based
information is accessible, as no personal information has
been provided. However, only a few studies have stud-
ied logged-in users, but they were more focused on how
PII is leaked and not about comparing the behavior of
websites for not-logged-in and logged-in users [9, 12].

In this paper, we address how logged-in versus not-
logged-in websites function with respect to visible-to-
users advertising (ads) and hidden-to-users trackers, ﬁn-
gerprinters, and analytics-oriented software, referred to
as privacy concerns in the remainder of this paper. We
conduct a comparison of 345 websites from 14 Alexa
web categories using a Firefox plugin we wrote. The
plugin crawls and captures information related to who
websites are communicating with and what information
they are transmitting. We then make two primary con-
tributions based on these 345 websites.

First, we characterize trends in ads and pri-
vacy concerns for individual websites and website cat-
egories for not-logged-in and logged-in users. Our re-
sults show that logged-in users are subjected to 1 more
ad and 1 more privacy concern per webpage than not-
logged-in users, who themselves are already subjected
to a staggering 5.9 ads and 6.3 privacy concerns per
page on average. Websites also appear to utilize larger
third parties to target and analyze users when logged-
in, based on the considerably higher rates encountered
for Google/DoubleClick and MoatAds. This ﬁrmly es-
tablishes that logged-in users are targeted more and im-
plies websites utilize their better knowledge of logged-in
users to target them more aggressively.

Website categories themselves vary greatly in the rates
of ads and privacy concerns logged-in users experience,
as we uncover two clusters: One in which users are sub-
ject to approximately 7-12 ads and concerns per page
(e.g. health and computer categories), or one in which
users are subject to 16-20 ads and concerns per page
(e.g. arts, news, and sports categories). We also dis-
cuss how regulations meant to protect user privacy, such
as COPPA for childrens’ PII [4], might result in fewer
third parties on websites that target children. This in-

111dicates that a regulatory approach for protecting user
PII may help to dissuade overzealous deployment of ads
and privacy concerning software.

Second, we enhance the earlier studies of PII leak-
age and explore the implications of more third par-
ties on logged-in websites by analyzing what PII is
highly desired by third parties, why it is desired,
and who receives this PII. We observed that 42% of
crawled websites leaked PII and that age/gender/zipcode
PII is more desired than ﬁrst/last/username PII based
on how often and how many third parties receive the
PII pieces. We then establish that 463 third parties re-
ceived at least 1 piece of PII, including 52 third parties
that received all tracked PII. We ﬁnish by discussing the
implications of the two largest ﬁrms that received all
tracked PII – Google and Facebook – and describe how
their prevalence on the Internet ultimately undermines
a user’s ability to escape some degree of information
leakage.
2. METHODOLOGY

Our methodology to conduct this study is broken into
three parts: our crawling apparatus, how and why we
logged into websites, and what information was col-
lected while crawling both not-logged-in and logged-in
websites.
2.1 Crawling Approach

For each website crawl, a new Firefox proﬁle and in-
stance are created using the same research server. Crawl
time of day was not controlled for. The crawler itself is
a Firefox add-on and is responsible for the navigation
of each website. Instead of limiting the website crawl
to a speciﬁc number of pages for each website, 60 min-
utes were allotted for each website crawl, with a time
limit of 30 seconds to load a webpage.
If a webpage
was loaded before the 30 second limit, the next web-
page would be navigated to immediately. This ensures
we visit as many webpages and collect as much data as
possible while also providing each webpage the oppor-
tunity to load its content. After the crawl completed,
the Firefox folder, proﬁle, and instance are deleted from
the server. This ensures that each crawl is independent
of each other by guaranteeing no state, e.g. cookies, is
maintained between crawls. On average, 287 webpages
(σ = 180) were crawled per website.

For navigation, the crawler follows a breadth-ﬁrst
strategy by triggering one of two types of navigation op-
tions: anchor tags which are HTML elements that have
a reference to another URL or JavaScript-based naviga-
tion which hides the navigation event inside JavaScript
code. If the navigation would result in visiting a page
outside of the domain being crawled or a page that was
already visited, it is ignored. This ensures the focus is
on the website being crawled, rather than other web-
sites.

2.2 Websites Crawled

The websites selected for use in this study come from
a selection of the top 500 websites in each Alexa cate-
gory, sans the adult and regional categories. For each
category, 30 websites were initially selected that met
two criteria: (i) the website only appeared in the top
500 of a single Alexa category and (ii) that an account
could be created on that website. The ﬁrst criteria is in
place to focus our analysis on websites that are popular
in one category, which helps us to avoid complicating
our analysis of website categories. The second criteria
ensures that each website can be used for the logged-in
portion of our study. This criteria resulted in 345 web-
sites crawled, with a breakdown by website category as
follows: arts (23), business (25), computers (26), games
(24), health (24), home (26), kids-and-teens (26), news
(24), recreation (23), reference (28), science (27), shop-
ping (19), society (27), and sports (23)1. Note that the
total number of websites per each category is less than
30 as several websites in each category were excluded
due to technical problems during one of the crawls: the
website blocked the crawler or the login process started
to require human veriﬁcation via captcha.

Once the websites were selected, accounts were man-
ually created. Personal information was only provided
during the account creation process and included: email,
ﬁrst name, last name, birth year, birth month, birth
day, gender, city, state, zipcode, timezone, and marital
status. The actual logging-in action was automated by
using the Selenium automation framework [16]. Once
logged-in, the Firefox crawler plugin would take over
navigation and information collection tasks.

Three diﬀerent datasets were created based on these

website crawls:

1. Not-Logged-In Website Crawl - Crawled each web-

site starting at the landing page.

2. Logged-In User on Not-Logged-In Webpages
- Logged into each website and then crawled the
exact same pages as visited by the not-logged-in
crawling process above. No new webpages are crawled,
which allows a direct comparison between results
in dataset 1 and 2 where the only change has been
our logged-in user.

3. Logged-In Websites - Logged into each website
and started the crawling process on the landing
page that is loaded after the login process com-
pletes, i.e. user homepage rather than the website
landing page used in dataset 1. This ensures user-
only webpages that are accessible are now crawled.

2.3 Data Collected During Crawl

The data that is collected during the crawling pro-
cess is focused on two things: identifying whether third

plored. This leakage information is then used to deter-
mine what PII is most sought after by third parties and
which third party domains receive the most PII.
3. AGGREGATE TRENDS IN WEBSITES
It is important to ﬁrst explore the aggregate behav-
ior for ads and privacy concerns when users are not-
logged-in versus logged-in, as it provides a baseline to
understand the current trends. Figure 1 shows that the
median (mean) number of ads observed rises from 2.8
(5.9) per page while not-logged-in to 3.9 (6.8) per page
while logged-in and that the third-quartile and upper-
limit of the boxplot has risen substantially for logged-
in users compared to not-logged-in users. This means
users are being targeted by at least one additional ad
per page when they are logged-in compared to when
they are not-logged-in.

parties on webpages are an ad or privacy concern, and
identifying when PII is leaked and who PII is leaked
to. To identify the third parties that are ads or privacy
concerns, we ﬁrst recorded each fully qualiﬁed domain
name (FQDN) that was successfully requested for each
webpage crawled. FQDN is used to classify a resource as
an ad or privacy concern to avoid incorrectly grouping
unrelated resources together, e.g. api.google.com and
ads.google.com both have google.com as their domain,
but one is ﬂagged as an ad and one is not.

We then calculated, for each website, the percent-
age of webpages that a particular FQDN appeared on.
However, this process resulted in 14233 total FQDNs,
which was too many to categorize as ads or privacy
concerns since manual eﬀort would be needed to clas-
sify any FQDN that was not already on a blacklist. To
resolve this issue, we grouped FQDNs by their website
category and then selected the top 80% of encountered
FQDNs by weight to be categorized. Doing this step for
each website category – rather than in aggregate – en-
sures we can identify ads or concerns that may appear
infrequently in aggregate but that do appear frequently
in a particular category. Limiting to the top 80% also
ensures we could focus on categorizing the most preva-
lent FQDNs while avoiding the very long tail of FQDNs
that were not frequently encountered.

This top 80% process resulted in 1167 FQDNs to
categorize2. We ﬁrst utilize blacklists – AdBlockPlus,
AdBlockPlus Privacy, and MalwareBytes Host-Files [1,
13] – which categorized 641 of the FQDNs as known
ads and privacy concerns. We then manually catego-
rize the remaining 526 with a label of ad, privacy con-
cern, or other. Next, we take the categorization of
each FQDN and count each ad encountered per page
to tally how many ads a user would see. Privacy con-
cerns are counted diﬀerently per page: once per FQDN
per page to reﬂect that the user is already exposed to
the FQDN once the ﬁrst concern is loaded. We can
then take these counts and determine the average num-
ber of categorized-FQDNs encountered for a website or
category; e.g, if a website has 10 webpages and three
diﬀerent privacy concerning FQDNs appeared on 3, 6,
and 8 webpages, then the average privacy concerns en-
countered per page would be: 3

10 = 1.7.

10 + 6

10 + 8

We also identify when PII is leaked to any domain
with respect to username, ﬁrst and last name, age, gen-
der, and zipcode. Domain is used, instead of the FQDN
process previously described, as we no longer need to
categorize each speciﬁc threat, e.g. ad vs privacy con-
cern. This change in measurement is also justiﬁed, since
once a domain receives PII, which FQDN received the
PII is likely immaterial to the risks the user has suf-
fered.
Information in HTTP requests, HTTP referer
information, and cookies set and retrieved were tracked
to identify when PII was leaked using conservative pat-

There are two explanations regarding why more ad-
vertising is observed on many of the logged-in versions
of websites: The user’s identity is known and the source
of the advertising is from larger advertising networks.
Guaranteed knowledge of the user’s identity is an im-
portant piece of information for both websites and ad-
vertising networks, as it represents a step forward from
guessing who a not-logged-in user is to deﬁnitively know-
ing that a particular proﬁle belongs to a speciﬁc user.
Once a proﬁle is linked to a user, more pertinent ads
can be served that target that particular user.

More ads from larger ad networks is borne out by in-
vestigating the sources of the logged-in advertisements.
Consider the following comparisons between the most
frequently observed advertising networks in our data.
securepubads.g.doubleclick.net appears on 9% of not-
logged-in webpages, but in 25% of logged-in webpages,
3A list of the patterns used is found at homes.soic.

113i.e., a user is seeing 16 more ads per 100 pages from this
source when logged-in. This phenomenon is continually
observed with other popular ad-networks or ad sup-
porting third parties: cm.g.doubleclick.net, pagead2.
googlesyndication.com, tpc.google-syndication.com, and
v4.moatads.com. Conversely, not-logged-in users are
simply not targeted as aggressively by these larger com-
panies, but instead have a potpourri of various ad-networks
with none appearing as frequently as the ad-networks
on logged-in websites.

Figure 1 also shows a similar picture for privacy con-
cerns encountered per page, as they increase from 5.1
(6.3) to 5.7 (7.1). Two things stand out with these in-
creases compared to ads: Users are already subjected to
a lot of privacy concerns and users likely do not realize
they are being targeted by so many concerns, as this
type of software is often present without any physical
signs to the user, unlike ads which are often directly ob-
servable. Explaining why the average website engages
with more privacy concerning third parties while a user
is logged-in is straightforward: Websites want to know
who their users are and what they are doing so they
can analyze what works on their website and plan what
to do next. This is especially true for logged-in users
who represent actively engaged users that are part of a
website’s core audience.

4. WEBSITE CATEGORY TRENDS

While the aggregate trend is that logged-in users are
subjected to more advertisements and privacy concerns,
this does not reveal the nuance in the data. Certain
website categories, such as Business and Kids and Teen,
actually treat logged-in users with less advertising and
privacy concerns overall compared to their not-logged-
in users. In order to understand how diﬀerent website
categories behave, we consider two diﬀerent pieces of
information: the average advertising and privacy con-
cerns per page while logged-in for each website category
as shown in Figure 2 and the percentage increase of con-
cerns from not-logged-in to logged-in as shown in Fig-
ure 3. Taken together, they highlight which categories
have more/less ads and privacy concerns while also in-
forming us which categories treat logged-in users better
or worse.
4.1 Logged-In Category Threats Per Page
Figure 2 shows a positive correlation (Pearson=0.78),
in that most categories have a similar number of ad
content and privacy concerning content. Certain cat-
egories, however, deviate from this trend, such as the
shopping and business categories that have less adver-
tising than would be expected. This is likely due to
the fact that they are already in the business of selling
goods and services, so it makes little sense to utilize ad-
vertising that may show a competitors goods. Indeed,
the websites in shopping and business that did have
more ads were actually aggregator websites that acted

Figure 2: The average ads and privacy concerns per page

as a jumping point to lead consumers to other busi-
nesses, e.g., ﬁnancial aggregator TheStreet advertising
investments to explore. However, shopping and busi-
ness websites have more privacy concerns than would
be expected compared to other categories, which also
makes sense as they need as much information on their
customers as possible so that they can better under-
stand and target them.

Website categories also appear to create two clus-
ters: high and higher amounts of ads and privacy con-
cerns. These clusters also appear in not-logged-in web-
site graph which is excluded for brevity. This means
that no website category is particularly good about the
amount of concerns they subject a user to, but it does
appear users can expect certain categories to behave
much worse. This matters a great deal when conduct-
ing future measurement studies, as the categories of
websites selected may have an outsized impact on the
amount of advertising or privacy concerns encountered,
which may lead to a potentially skewed view of any
widespread trends.
4.2 Increases in Logged-In Website Mea-

sures

Using the information in Figure 3 we highlight three
diﬀerent conclusions about how websites treat logged-
in users diﬀerently: how categories of websites behave
with respect to the aggregate trend; how the percent-
age change between not-logged-in and logged-in is de-
ceptive; and how the kids-and-teens website category
represents a case study that regulatory approaches to
protecting users may in fact work. First, the aggregate
trend of more ads and privacy concerning content while
logged-in held true for most website categories. Only
three website categories – kids, business, and society
– treated logged-in users with less ads or less privacy
concerns. We focus on the society and kids-and-teens

114categories, as they represent diﬀerent outcomes for why
they have lower rates of ads or privacy concerns.

vertising, as such third parties likely will seek to receive
PII. Table 1 details statistics about the number of web-
sites crawled where PII was observed to be leaked in
the logged-in websites, including leak rate and leak ra-
tio: Leak rate is the percentage of websites that had
access to a piece of PII and leaked it; leak ratio is the
number of third party domains each website leaked it
to on average.

Figure 3: Percent change in advertising and privacy con-
cerns when a user is logged-in versus not-logged-in, ρ =

The society category represents a potential pitfall when
using percent change as the only analysis between logged-
in and not-logged-in websites. Based on the change
from not-logged-in to logged-in, the society category
appears to be the third most “respectful” category with
small increases in ads and a small decrease in the num-
ber of privacy concerns. However, if we refer to the av-
erage number of threats observed while logged-in from
Figure 2, we notice that the society category is among
the most ﬂagrant in the amount of ads and privacy con-
cerns used. When we combine these facts, we can un-
derstand that the threat to a logged-in user visiting a
society website is already very high, so the marginal
percentage change observed is misleading.

A positive result in percent change comes from the
kids-and-teens category. When we examine both scatter-
plots together, we can observe that logged-in users of
kids websites are subjected to less ads and less pri-
vacy concerns, in addition to having one of the lowest
volumes of ads and privacy concerns per website cat-
egory. This matters greatly, as it indicates that well
known privacy protecting regulations, such as COPPA
for children, might actually work by dissuading website
operators from being overzealous in their use of ads or
privacy concerns. Note that this does not eliminate the
threat a privacy regulation may address, which requires
enforcement, but it does appear to restrict the amount
of potentially problematic third parties.

5. PII LEAKAGE

The key risk of being logged-in to a website is that
PII provided to websites can be leaked. PII itself is
valuable information for user proﬁling and targeted ad-

Table 1: Number of websites that had access to and leaked
a particular piece of PII.

At a high level, we observed that 42% (144) of the
websites crawled revealed PII to a third party, while
each piece of PII was leaked by 11-32% of the websites.
We further break the discussion of PII into two parts:
Section 5.1 describes how the leak rate and ratio high-
light what PII is desired by third parties; Section 5.2
details the widespread nature of third parties, which
undermines user control of their PII.
5.1 Leak Rates and Ratios

Looking at leak rates and ratios can determine what
PII is highly desired by third parties. Consider the
higher leak ratios for age, gender, and zipcode. There
is value to knowing each piece of PII individually, but
the real value comes from the fact that 60-90% of on-
line users can be identiﬁed in the real-world based on
this trifecta of PII [7]. Attaching a real person to online
data is no doubt an incredibly attractive proposition for
advertisers. Our data shows 183 third parties received
each piece of this PII and that each website that leaks
this trifecta shared it with 17+ third parties. Such a
high leak rate combined with the known value of this
PII shows that using leak rates/ratios to identify PII
desirability has merit and highlights what information
is actually coveted by third parties.

Name-related PII also has value, but its utility seems
to be less than age/gender/zipcode. For example, user-
name was leaked by 32% of websites to a 421 third par-
ties, including Google, Facebook, and other large ad
companies. Since a username is fairly consistent across
websites – especially when it is an email address – re-
liable access to such information can provide an easy
way to re-identify users across websites, which is use-
ful for tracking. First and last names themselves have
demographic utility, as names can imply gender, eth-
nicity, and age [17]. However, this information is more
inferential than the age/gender/zipcode PII, which is

is directly observed using PII, e.g. in URL arguments or by
setting cookies.

likely why they have lower desirability and therefore
have lower leak ratios. Third parties still want this PII,
but it is not as useful as the previous trifecta.

In general, the leak ratios observed imply a slippery
slope exists where websites are not likely to leak PII –
based on low leak rates – but when they do leak PII they
tend to do so aggressively. This low leak rate and high
leak ratio phenomenon means a user can never trust
that their PII is kept private, as enough websites leak
PII to a large number of third parties that users can
quickly lose control of their PII, even if they are trying
to avoid such a fate.
5.2 Wide Reach of Third Party Concerns
While leak rates and ratios establish how often and
how desirable PII is, it does not tell us who is receiving
the PII. Table 2 shows that 52 diﬀerent third party do-
mains received access to all six PII we tracked. Eighteen
domains were directly observed having the PII in their
own HTTP communication and can be described as a
veritable who’s who of prominent advertising and pri-
vacy concerning ﬁrms: Facebook, Google-based proper-
ties (Google, GoogleSyndication, Doubleclick, and Google-
Analytics), ScoreCardResearch, Blue Kai, MoatAds, Ad-
Nxs, Pixalate, Pubmatic, AddThis, RFIHub, and Ad-
SafeProtect. The purpose of each of these 18 ﬁrms is
audience proﬁling or targeted advertising, which fur-
ther solidiﬁes the assertion that they want PII to build
proﬁles of users.

While each of the 18 domains appeared on at least
10% of the webpages we crawled, the most widespread
were various Google properties which were 7 of the 10
most encountered and appeared on 343 of 345 websites.
The second most prominent ﬁrm that received all PII
is Facebook, which appeared on 40% of the logged-in
webpages. Facebook represents an interesting case as
users likely consider it an OSN rather than an advertis-
ing/analytics company. As an OSN, it can be expected
that registered users will provide PII to Facebook to
fully utilize the services. However, our results ﬁnd that
non-users end up providing enough PII via leakage to
pre-register our fake individual on the Facebook web-
site – all that is missing is a proﬁle picture! Essentially,
Facebook is as capable of tracking registered users as

they are of a non-user, even without that user’s con-
sent.

6. RELATED WORK

Most similar to our work is that conducted by Krish-
namurthy and Wills in 2011, who conducted a logged-in
study of how and what was leaked on 120 websites [9].
Another study in 2013 created a tool to trace PII leak-
age and followed up on the 2011 study by exploring 180
logged-in websites [12]. While our study overlaps in
exploring the leakage of PII, our paper addresses addi-
tional issues: we compare behavior while logged-in and
not-logged-in and we look at valuing PII based on the
ratio of the leakage.

Other studies explored how seemingly benign leaks
could impact users. Chaabane et al.
found that large
OSNs, such as Facebook and Twitter can easily track
users across websites through the use of cookies and
HTTP referer information [3]. Libert reviewed the leak-
age of health searches through simple browsing of health-
care websites [11]. We expand upon these types of stud-
ies by showcasing how websites behave for logged-in
users, noting that many of these trends are worse for
logged-in users.

Other research has primarily approached identifying
a user in the absence of PII. The Panopticlick project
established the validity of using machine-based infor-
mation to uniquely identify users [5]. Nikiforakis et al.
extended upon the Panopticlick project by showing how
such approaches are used in practice by actual tracking
ﬁrms [15]. Others have shown that font-based ﬁnger-
printing [2] and canvas ﬁngerprinting [14] are also valid
approaches to ﬁngerprint users with machine-based in-
formation that is harder to obscure. Meanwhile oth-
ers have taken this information and utilized it to au-
tomatically identify these machine-based attempts, e.g.
identifying suspicious cookies [10] or access to browser
information [8]. While we did not focus on measur-
ing machine-based identiﬁcation in this paper, such ap-
proaches have a place in future studies to measure this
particular behavior.

7. CONCLUSION

More research angles exist with which to study logged-
in and not-logged-in website behavior. First, less pop-
ular websites were not explored in our study due to the
diﬃculty in ﬁnding a representative set of websites for
each category. Since diﬀerent categories treat users dif-
ferently, it is imperative to have a representative sample
to reach stronger conclusions. Secondly, a more detailed
exploration of website categories may yet reveal more
interesting nuances, such as category speciﬁc advertis-
ers. Additionally, there is more room to focus on who
is getting PII, how they are using it, and what rela-
tion these companies have with each other – including
if they share PII or cooperate in other ways that may
undermine a user’s ability to trust websites they use.
