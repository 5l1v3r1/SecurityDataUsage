ABSTRACT
We present the ﬁrst study of broadband services in their
broader context, evaluating the impact of service character-
istics (such as capacity, latency and loss), their broadband
pricing and user demand. We explore these relationships,
beyond correlation, with the application of natural experi-
ments. Most eﬀorts on broadband service characterization
have so far focused on performance and availability, yet we
lack a clear understanding of how such services are being
utilized and how their use is impacted by the particulars of
the market. By analyzing over 23-months of data collected
from 53,000 end hosts and residential gateways in 160
countries, along with a global survey of retail broadband
plans, we empirically study the relationship between broad-
band service characteristics, pricing and demand. We show
a strong correlation between capacity and demand, even
though subscribers rarely fully utilize their links, but note a
law of diminishing returns with relatively smaller increases
in demand at higher capacities. Despite the fourfold increase
in global IP traﬃc, we ﬁnd that user demand on the network
over a three year period remained constant for a given
bandwidth capacity. We exploit natural experiments to
examine the causality between these factors. The reported
ﬁndings represent an important step towards understanding
how user behavior, and the market features that shape it,
aﬀect broadband networks and the Internet at large.

INTRODUCTION

As one of the most economically signiﬁcant and fastest
growing sectors of the Internet [19], broadband networks
have attracted interest from researchers, network operators,
and policy makers. Over the past decade, the number of
broadband networks has increased rapidly. The latest “State
of Broadband” reports that there are over 60 countries where
ﬁxed or mobile broadband penetration is above 25% and
more than 70 countries where the majority of the population
is online [4]. Providing broadband Internet access is known
to be instrumental in social and economic development [35].
Several governments (including France, Finland and Spain)
and the UN have even labeled broadband access a basic
human right, similar to education and water.

While several recent and ongoing eﬀorts have shed light on
the performance and availability of broadband services [1,2,
5, 12, 20, 28, 31, 33, 34], we lack a clear understanding of how
these services are being used and how this use is impacted
by the particulars of the market. The goal of our work is to
examine broadband services in this broader context. How
much bandwidth do people actually need? How does price
aﬀect usage? Do users in developing and developed countries
impose diﬀerent demands on their services? What is the
impact of connection quality on usage?

We analyze over 23 months of information collected from
53,000 end hosts [30] and residential gateways [15] in 160
countries, along with a global survey of retail broadband
plans [27]. We quantify the relationship between user
demand on the network, retail price of available broadband
services and the performance of the service to which the
user subscribes. We observe a law of diminishing returns
in the relationship between broadband capacity and the
average/peak demand users put on their broadband link,
implying that adding extra capacity on an already wide
broadband line leads to a minor increment in user demand.
Looking at the longitudinal data, we ﬁnd, somewhat
surprisingly, that despite the fourfold increase in global IP
traﬃc over the past ﬁve years [10], subscribers’ demand
in the same bandwidth capacity class remained constant,
indicating that users “jump” to a higher service when their
demand grows, rather than fully utilize their existing pipe.
We study in depth the service upgrade dynamics and report
our ﬁndings.

In a study such as this, controlled experiments are not
feasible for studying the features of interest at scale. A
key contribution of our work is thus a methodology for
combining broadband measurement and retail price datasets
along with the application of natural experiments to get

73to a problem otherwise impossible to tackle. We use
natural experiments to examine the interaction between
price, the quality of services available, and users’ demands.
We show that higher broadband prices increase demand
when comparing users of similar capacities across markets.
Additionally, we ﬁnd that very high packet loss rates (over
1%) and latencies (above 500 ms) result in signiﬁcantly lower
usage.

Our study oﬀers several insights on the interplay between
user demand and broadband market features that are of
value to the research community, network operators and
policy makers. For network operators, an understanding of
how user behavior changes with the network and broadband
market can better inform network planning and operation.
For policy makers, the work provides a ﬁrmer statistical
footing for discussions on broadband incentives.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we
explain our analysis methodology, describe our datasets, and
summarize the performance of the broadband connections
seen in our global dataset. We explore the impact of
capacity on demand in Sec. 3, followed by a longitudinal
study that investigates how demand changes over time in
Sec. 4. In Sec. 5, 6, and 7 we study the impact of the price
of broadband access, the cost of increasing capacity, and the
connection quality on user demand, respectively. We then
review related work in Sec. 8, summarize and discuss our
ﬁndings in Sec. 9, and conclude in Sec. 10.

2. ANALYSIS METHODS AND DATASETS
In the following paragraphs we describe the three datasets
we rely on for analysis, including a summary of key charac-
teristics for the broadband connections they capture. We
close the section with a brief discussion of the goals and
methodology of our study.
2.1 Datasets

Our study builds on three datasets, two of broadband
connections including:
(i) measurements from residential
gateways in the US, and (ii) detailed end-host collected data
on broadband connections from around the world, and (iii)
a compilation of retail broadband connectivity plans made
available by Google [27]. We describe each of these in the
following paragraphs.

Residential gateway data. Since 2010, the FCC, in
collaboration with SamKnows, has publicly shared data
collected from residential gateways distributed to broadband
users around the US as part of the “Measuring Broadband
America” eﬀort [15]. Users that participate in this study
were either selected to participate by their ISP or signed up
through SamKnows’ website. The data collected from these
gateways includes measurements of link capacity, latency
and packet loss as well as hourly recordings of the number
of bytes sent and received over the WAN link.

End host data. Our end-host collected dataset comes
from Dasu [30], a previously released network experimenta-
tion and broadband measurement client. Dasu is available
as both an extension to BitTorrent and as a standalone
client. As an incentive for adoption, Dasu informs users of
their ISP’s performance, providing detailed information on
their home network conﬁguration, the volume of network
traﬃc sent and received by the localhost, the volume of
detected cross traﬃc in the home network, and the results of
performance measurements on their ISP (e.g. a comparison

of their ISP’s web browsing and DNS performance). Dasu
records network usage data from the localhost and home
network to account for cross traﬃc during characterization
or the execution of network experiments.

Since its release, Dasu has been installed by over 100,000
users in over 160 countries, with the majority of clients
using the BitTorrent extension. From this dataset, we select
users that either have UPnP enabled on their home gateway
device or those that were directly connected to their modem
(thus their machine is the only device generating traﬃc).
UPnP-enabled gateways provide byte counters that we use
to measure activity on the link, taking into account issues
with UPnP counters raised in other works [11,29]. For users
directly connected to their modem, we use byte counters
available from netstat to monitor network usage (available
by default on most popular operating systems). Traﬃc byte
counters are collected at approximately 30 second intervals
with some variations due to scheduling.

As it is the case with all observational studies, there is a
concern about potential biases in our datasets, coming either
from P2P or SamKnow’s users (e.g., uniquely demanding
users, early-adopters or “geek-eﬀect” [5, 20, 25]. We account
for some of these issues throughout our analysis by, for
instance, focusing on measurements gathered when users are
not actively downloading/uploading content on BitTorrent,
restricting our users to those directly connected to a modem
or wirelessly connected to a UPnP-enabled one, using
neighbor matching with a caliper to ensure close matches.
On the potential biases with our P2P users’ data, we show
in Sec. 3.1 that the average demand of Dasu users in the
US – when not actively using BitTorrent – is comparable to
that of participants in the FCC’s study.

Connectivity plans. Our third dataset is a compilation
of international retail broadband connectivity plans, made
available by Google on their “Policy by the Numbers”
blog [27]. This data was compiled by Communications
Chambers, a consultant group, by visiting the websites of
broadband service providers around the world. The dataset
covers 1,523 service plans across 99 countries.
It includes
information on the upload and download speeds of each
plan, the monthly traﬃc limits, and monthly cost in the
local currency. We selected this dataset over those provided
by the FCC, OECD, or ITU given the breadth of countries
included and the depth of plans listed. The FCC and
OECD datasets focus on the US and members of the OECD
while the ITU dataset only includes a single service plan for
each country. In a few cases, we expanded this dataset by
manually visiting the websites of ISPs in countries where we
had users but no broadband price data.

To directly compare the price of broadband plans across
diﬀerent economies, we convert the monthly cost to US
dollars. We account for diﬀerences in relative purchasing
power in each country by using the purchasing power parity
(PPP) to market exchange ratio.
In most cases, this
is included in the broadband service survey provided by
Google. When that is not the case, we use publicly available
data from the International Monetary Fund’s website1. All
monetary ﬁgures throughout this work are normalized by
purchasing power parity, including the GDP per capita data
provided by the International Monetary Fund that we use
later in our case study.

2.2 Broadband Networks Characteristics

We now describe the diversity of broadband connections
in our global dataset, presenting distributions of their
measured capacity, latency and packet loss. All the Dasu
data were collected by running M-Lab’s Network Diagnostic
Tool (NDT) [23] within Dasu. NDT reports the upload and
download capacity of a connection, as well as its end-to-end
latency and packet loss rates.

Capacity. Figure 1a shows a CDF of the maximum
download capacities, in Mbps, measured over each user’s
connection in our dataset. Our distribution has a median
user download capacity of 7.4 Mbps and interquartile range
of 14.3 Mbps (from 3.1 Mbps to 17.4 Mbps). Approximately
10% of users have download capacities below 1 Mbps, while
the top 10% of users have capacities above 30 Mbps.

Latency. For latency, we measured the average latency
to the closest NDT measurement server. Since measurement
servers are hosted in a diverse set of networks of content
providers (e.g. Google) and content distribution networks
(e.g. Level 3), we believe such measurements provides
a reasonable estimate of the latency to popular content.
Figure 1b shows the distribution of measured latencies. We
ﬁnd that a “typical” user in our dataset has an average RTT
of about 100 ms to the nearest NDT servers. The top 5%
of users had an average latency above 500 ms. Based on the
organization names that we found via whois lookups, the
majority of connections with very high latencies appeared to
be connecting over wireless modems or satellite providers.

Packet loss. Figure 1c shows the distribution of average
packet loss rates reported by NDT tests. While the loss
rate is relatively low for most users (less than 0.1%),
approximately 14% of users saw an average loss rate above
1%. For the top 1% of users, average loss rates were above
10%. As was the case with high latency connections, the
organization names of networks with very high packet loss
rates indicated they were satellite or wireless (e.g. WiMAX,
cellular) services.

2.3 Methodology

The main goal of our study is to provide insight into
the impact of broadband service market characteristics on
network usage. Speciﬁcally, we study the impact of the
following market features: connection capacity, the price
of broadband access, the cost of increasing capacity, and
connection quality. While there are many other variables

that can aﬀect user behavior, this set covers the key
characteristics of broadband service markets. Given the
rapid pace of development in broadband and the reported
growth in network traﬃc, we also conduct a longitudinal
analysis of user demands on broadband services.

Beyond gathering a suﬃciently large and diverse per-
spective of broadband connections, a key challenge for a
macroscopic study such as ours is the nature of experiments
one is able to conduct. Classical controlled experiments
– where subjects in the study are randomly assigned to
“treated” and “untreated” groups for comparison – are clearly
not feasible at a global scale.
It is also unlikely that
the features we explore are independent, e.g., one would
assume that price or service diversity can impact capacity
and service quality. This has been a long, well understood
problem in a range of ﬁelds, from epidemiology to sociology
and economics. We address this challenge, as many studies
do in those domains, by resorting to natural experiments in
our analysis [14].

By using natural experiments [14] and related study
designs, we remedy the fact that we cannot control the
application of a treatment, Matching users in our treated
group with similar users in the untreated group we sim-
ulate random or as-good-as-random assignment, manually
ensuring that diﬀerences are evenly distributed between the
two groups. This allows us to infer whether or not the
relationship observed are likely to be causal. For example,
to test if bandwidth capacity aﬀects user demand, we pair
users that are similar in terms of connection quality and
broadband market. We then check if the user with higher
capacity generates more traﬃc. If so, our hypothesis holds
true for that pair. After testing this for each pair of
similar users, we calculate the percentage of times that our
hypothesis is correct.

If neither of the two variables under study – in this
example, capacity and demand – have an impact on the
other, then their interaction would be random.
In our
example this would mean, for instance, that lower capacity
will result in lower (or higher) demand about 50% of the
time. Signiﬁcant deviations from this would suggest that a
causal relationship is likely to exist between the two.

We use the one-tailed binomial test to measure the
statistical signiﬁcance of deviations from the expected dis-
tribution. As is common in many study designs, we consider
a p-value that is less than 0.05 to be a strong presumption

against the null hypothesis (H0). One potential issue with
our application of the binomial test in this context is the
known problem that given a large enough dataset, the test
will consider even minor deviations to be signiﬁcant. That
is, with a large enough sample of throws, an unbiased coin
could fail to pass a χ2 test for ﬁtting the predicted binomial
distribution [26]. To account for this issue, we only consider
deviations larger than 2% to be practically important. In
other words the hypothesis holds at least 52% of the time.

3.

IMPACT OF CAPACITY

The interplay between broadband service characteristics
and user demand is complex [36]. For instance, while
subscribers cannot directly aﬀect the cost of their service,
they have some freedom in choosing what package (capacity)
they purchase and how much traﬃc they generate. On the
other hand, although they come with needs and budgets
when choosing a broadband plan, once acquired, their usage
patterns are shaped by their selection.
In addition, there
is the potential impact of seemingly irrational and biased
choices by subscribers [16, 32] that complicates any attempt
at understanding and analytical modeling of the drivers
of users’ choices and demand. While we (or even most
customers [17]) may not know the advertised service of a
broadband connection, our study focuses on the impact of
the actual maximum capacity provided to the user.

In this section, we begin to empirically explore the
complex interactions between broadband service market
features and user behavior by ﬁrst studying the eﬀects of
capacity on user demand. When appropriate, we compare
data collected from end hosts (via Dasu) and residential
gateways (FCC/SamKnows).

3.1 Capacity vs. usage

We ﬁrst explore the relationship between access link
capacity and the demand users generate on the access
network. To describe user demand, we rely on two metrics
of usage: the average and peak volume of traﬃc generated.
We deﬁne peak as the 95th-percentile value of the time series
(sampled every 30-secs) of downlink demand for each user.

Figure 2 presents both the mean and peak demand, for
diﬀerent classes of users based on their measured downlink
capacity. Given the range of services across the diﬀerent
markets we analyze, we split services into ten classes where
every user in class (k) has a download capacity in the range
of (100Kbps ∗ 2k−1, 100Kbps ∗ 2k]. We analyze usage both
throughout the entire measurement period (Fig. 2a and 2b)
and during periods when users are not actively uploading or
downloading content on BitTorrent (Fig. 2c and 2d).

We also contrast Dasu’ end-host collected data with that
of users in the FCC study (gateway collected data), looking
both at average and peak network usage. Figure 3 shows the
mean and peak (95th percentile) demand of users, grouped
by capacity, in the FCC and US-based Dasu dataset (when
not using BitTorrent). Although the average usage is slightly
higher for Dasu users, the peak usage is nearly identical for
both groups. The diﬀerence in average demand is likely due
to the fact that the FCC data is collected evenly throughout
the 24-hour period, while Dasu usage (and thus our data) is
partially biased towards peak usage hours.

We ﬁnd that usage grows with capacity, as the plots of
Fig. 2 and 3 clearly show. This is despite the fact that users
rarely utilize their link (even at the 95th percentile, average
utilization ranges between 10 and 48%). For both mean and
95th percentile usage, with and without BitTorrent traﬃc,
we ﬁnd that usage is strongly correlated with the group’s
link capacity (r ≥ 0.87 for each).

Figure 2 also show that as capacity increases, usage
begins to level oﬀ (related to the ﬁndings in Sundaresan et
al. [34]). This would suggest that the relationship follows a
law of diminishing returns: the relative increase in demand
is greater for lower capacity connections than for higher
capacity connections.
3.2 Inferring causality

While the access capacity and the demand users generate
are strongly correlated, inferring the causality between these
variables is signiﬁcantly more challenging. For instance,
demand might drive capacity (i.e. users sign up for faster
services because they have access to applications with higher
bandwidth needs, such as HD video streaming) or be driven
by it, with users changing their behavior when given a higher

capacity and generating a higher demand. Additionally,
there may be other factors that aﬀect user demand such
as the quality of the connection or the price of access.

To explore a causal relationship between access capacity
and demand, we ﬁrst design a natural experiment to see
if the behavior of individual users changes when switching
between networks of diﬀerent capacities. This let us test
the idea that when given a higher capacity link, users will
increase their demand on the network. We then compare
the demand of users that are similar in terms of price of
broadband access, cost to upgrade, and link quality but
diﬀer in terms of service capacity.

User upgrades. To determine if their relationship
between capacity and demand is causal, we need to account
for diﬀerences in usage patterns between diﬀerent users. We
do this by looking at how individual users change their
network demand when switching to faster services, allowing
us to determine if the relationship between capacity and
demand is likely causal.

Figure 4 presents the CDFs of mean and peak download
link usage for users switching between a ”slow” and ”fast”
network. Both average and peak volume of traﬃc are when
the client is not active on BitTorrent. Each network is
identiﬁed by a tuple (ISP name, network preﬁx, geolocated
city). For both average and peak demand, we see that usage
tends to be considerably higher on the faster network. For
example, at the median, average usage doubles from 95 kbps
to 189 kbps and peak usage (95th percentile) more than
triples, from 192 kbps to 634 kbps.

(b) 95th %ile

Figure 4: CDFs of the mean and peak download
link usage for individual users on “slow” and “fast”
networks when not using BitTorrent.

To validate this assertion we use a natural experiment.
Our hypothesis (H) is that when a user moves from a slower
to a faster service, demand will increase. As such, our null
hypothesis (H0) is that demand will not be aﬀected by a
change in capacity. We test this assertion for both the mean
and peak demand and present our results in Table 1. As the
table shows, our original hypothesis (H), is true 66.8% of
the time when comparing average demand and 70.3% of the
time for peak demand. For both metrics, we ﬁnd very small
p-values, leading us to reject the null hypothesis (H0) that
capacity does not aﬀect the demand of individual users.

For these analysis we limit our data to that collected while
the users were not generating BitTorrent traﬃc. Including
BitTorrent traﬃc, we ﬁnd an even higher increase in usage,
and so is the percentage of the time that our hypothesis
holds true. This is likely due to the fact that users are more
likely to saturate their link for extended periods of time
when using BitTorrent [9].

Impact of switching services. To further understand
the interaction between capacity and demand, we explore
the impact of service upgrades on demand, for diﬀerent
initial capacities of connections. Figure 5 shows the average
change in demand, grouping upgrades by the “before” and
“after” download capacities. The labels on the x-axis
represent the capacity range of the initial service and each
bar is the average change in demand when switching to a
faster service in the respective capacity tier.

As the ﬁgure shows,

for each metric, demand clearly
increases when upgrading from slower services, particularly
when looking at peak (95th percentile) usage. Increases in

demand are less consistent when switching between already
fast services, particularly above 16 Mbps, where there is
a large variance on demand growth with capacity.
In
some cases, the large range in the 95% conﬁdence interval
shows that the upgrade likely had no signiﬁcant impact on
usage. These ﬁndings suggest that while capacities do drive
demand, this is only true up to a certain point.

All users. We expand our comparison to all users in the
datasets and use a matching study design to test the impact
of increased capacity. As before, we place users into one
of k bins, where k = (100Kbps ∗ 2k−1, 100Kbps ∗ 2k]. We
then compare the usage of users in bins k and k + 1. Our
hypothesis (H) is that users in the “treated” group, k+1, will
have a higher demand on the network due to their increased
capacity. Our null hypothesis (H0) is that the relationship
is random and increased capacity will not result in higher
demand.

To compare users from each group, however, we must en-
sure that each pair of users is similar in terms of connection
quality (packet loss and latency), price of broadband access,
and cost to upgrade capacity. For this and the remaining
studies, we use nearest neighbor matching to pair similar
users in “control” and “treatment” groups. We use a caliper
to ensure that dissimilar users are not matched, requiring
that users be within 25% of each other for each confounding
factor. This means, for instance, that users with latencies of
50 and 62 ms and in regions where broadband Internet access
costs $25 and $30 (USD) per month are considered to be
suﬃciently similar in terms of latency and cost of broadband
access. Note the trade-oﬀ here, a tighter caliper will yield a
potentially more accurate comparison, but will also reduced
the number of comparisons we can perform.

The increase in demand is statistically signiﬁcant while
comparing groups of users with capacities less or equal to
6.4 Mbps (though the achieved p-value when comparing
groups (6.4, 12.8] and (12.8, 25.6]
is very close to 0.05).
When comparing users in bins above 12.8 Mbps, the dif-
ference tends to become random and our hypothesis holds
about 50% the time. These results suggest that increasing
capacity beyond ≈10 Mbps is less likely to have a signiﬁcant
impact on peak user demand.

For the FCC data, increased capacity tends to result in
increased demand across all bins. We believe that this is
largely due to the fact that the FCC vantage point set is
comprised solely of users in the US, where higher capacity
broadband services are available, but at a moderately higher
price (this does not apply in many of the countries in our
study). We also observed a similar trend of increased usage
when studying Dasu users in the US, as we will show in
Sec. 5.

4. LONGITUDINAL TRENDS IN USAGE

The last few years have witnessed a rapid growth on
the capacity, coverage and aﬀordability of broadband net-
works [4]. Concurrently, the volume of digital content and
total IP traﬃc continue to grow at rapid pace. A recent
Cisco report states that the total IP traﬃc has increased
18-fold since 2.4 exabytes in 2005 [10]. Meanwhile, the size
of the “digital universe”, the total amount of data created
and replicated reported to be 2.8 zettabytes in 2012, doubles
in size about every two years [18]. In this section, we look
for changes in demand over time to see if these changes are
reﬂected, and in what manner, in the network demand of
broadband users.

To this end, we carry a longitudinal analysis of broadband
connections in our dataset. We compare changing trends in
usage relative to capacity, both average and peak, between
2011 and 2013. Figure 6 shows average and demand over
this period, with and excluding BitTorrent traﬃc.

Trends in relative use are surprisingly diﬀerent than what
we expected. Despite the fourfold increase in global IP
traﬃc, we ﬁnd that subscribers’ demand on the network
remained constant at each speed tier. While we note a
slight increase in demand for users with very fast connections
(about 100 Mbps), overall the demand within the same
broadband class has remained fairly consistent throughout
the observation period.

Using a natural experiment, we are unable to ﬁnd any
signiﬁcant change in demand at any given speed tier between
2011 and 2013.
It would appear that growth in traﬃc is
likely due to an increase in the number of broadband sub-
scriptions and the increased capacity of available services.

5. PRICE OF BROADBAND ACCESS

This section examines the impact that the price of
broadband access has on user demand.
In recent years,
we have seen signiﬁcant growth in the number of people
accessing the Internet [4]. While increased aﬀordability has
played a critical role in this growth, the price of broadband
Internet access remains unaﬀordable in many parts of the
developing world.
In countries like Iran and Botswana,
a 1 Mbps plan could cost as much as $150 USD per
month, after accounting for purchasing power parity (PPP).

Table 3: Percentage of the time that increased price
results in increased usage for pairs of similar users
and corresponding p-values.

Contrast this with countries like Germany, Japan, and the
US, where a 1 Mbps plan (or faster) are available for less
than $25 per month.

We have seen how, up to a point, demand increases
with capacity. If price is a factor that aﬀects a customers’
decision when selecting a broadband plan, then we would
expect that higher prices will result in users signing up for
lower capacity services despite their needs. Similarly, if two
services with similar speeds are available at diﬀerent prices
in two markets, we would expect that the service in the more
expensive market would experience higher network demand
since subscribers are willing to pay more for it.

We design the following study to test this idea. We
deﬁne our hypothesis (H) such that users in markets where
broadband Internet access is more expensive will have
higher demands on the network than users in less expensive
markets. Our null hypothesis (H0) then, is that increased
price does not have an aﬀect on network demand.

For this experiment, we ﬁrst need to group users based
on price of broadband access in their region. We deﬁne the
price of broadband access in a country as the monthly cost
(USD PPP) of the cheapest service with a capacity of at least
1 Mbps. We grouped users by the cost of broadband access
using the following bins: less than $25 per month, between
$25 and $60 per month, and over $60 per month. Users in
countries such as Germany, Japan, and the US ﬁt in the
ﬁrst bin (< $25 per month). Countries such as Mexico, New
Zealand, and the Philippines had prices between $25 and
$60 per month, while prices in counties such as Botswana,
Saudi Arabia, and Iran were above $60 per month.

After placing users into groups based on the monthly price
of broadband access, we compared the demand of otherwise
similar pairs of users in each group. In these experiments, we
use peak usage (when not active on BitTorrent) to measure
demand.2 For this experiment, users are “treated” with
an increased cost, which our hypothesis says will increase
demand. The results are shown in Table 3. We ﬁnd that
indeed, as price increases, more users have a higher demand
than those with a similar connection where access is cheaper.
Case study. We now illustrate the impact that price can
have on usage with a concrete example using four markets:
Botswana, Saudi Arabia, the US and Japan. We selected
these four as examples of the diversity of markets in our
dataset.

We chose Botswana and Saudi Arabia given that both
countries were among those with the highest broadband ac-
cess costs, but diﬀered in terms of typical service capacities.
Since its independence Botswana has enjoyed one of the
highest GDP growth rates in the world.3 In recent years, the
country has seen rapid growth in the percentage of citizens

calculate the monthly cost in each country as a percentage of monthly income.

with access to the Internet (from 3% in 2005 to 12% in
20134). The cost of Internet access in Botswana, however,
remains comparatively high. A 1 Mbps service, including a
phone line, from Botswana Telecom costs about $150 per
month after accounting for purchasing power parity.
In
contrast, a 1 Mbps service in the US would cost about $20
per month.

Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has also experienced
rapid growth in both GDP per capita (PPP) and the number
of Internet subscribers. The percentage of the population
using the Internet has tripled from just under 20% in 2007 to
over 60% in 2013. However, according to the ITU only about
5% of the population with broadband subscriptions are on
services faster than 10 Mbps (we see a similar percentage in
our global dataset). A 1 Mbps connection is also relatively
expensive in Saudi Arabia at about $60 USD (PPP) per
month, three times higher than a similar service in the US.
We include the US in our study as it presents another
interesting case as one of the most diverse broadband service
markets in terms of the available download capacities (from
about 1 Mbps to over 100 Mbps). Japan, on the other hand,
is one of the markets with widest availability of high-end
broadband services. While the range of broadband service
prices are similar to those in the US market, a larger fraction
of users in Japan subscribes to high capacity services.

Table 4 summarizes the users and services seen in each
market. We calculate the “typical” price of broadband in
each of the country by matching the median capacity to the

nearest service in our dataset. Compared to the US and
Japan, customers in Botswana and Saudi Arabia are paying
much more for slower services, especially as a fraction of
monthly GDP per capita. Users in both Japan and the
US appear to spend a similar fraction of monthly GDP
per capita (1.3%). However, ISPs in Japan oﬀered higher
capacities at the same fraction of monthly income. As a
result, users in Japan were more likely to subscribe to faster
services.

(Botswana, Saudi Arabia, the US, Japan). We ﬁnd a large
number of Botswana users on a ≈ 512 kbps service while
users in Saudi Arabia are heavily clustered around 4 Mbps.
Both the US and Japan show a wider distribution across
diﬀerent service levels. In Japan, however, a higher fraction
of users are on high-end services. The majority of users
in Japan (60%) have download speeds of at least 25 Mbps,
compared with over 71% of users in the US who are on
services slower than 25 Mbps.

It is interesting to contrast maximum download through-
out rates with the fraction of the link utilized during peak
usage for each user in these four countries (Fig. 7b). The
countries appears in exactly reverse order. Botswana shows
the highest peak utilization while Japan shows the lowest.
In Japan, and to some extent in the US, links tend to be
very underutilized, even at the 95th percentile.

Based on our earlier ﬁndings, we expect that users
in Botswana and Saudi Arabia will have higher network
demands than users with similar services in the US, due to
increased costs. On the other hand, users in Japan should
have lower demand on the network than users with similar
services in the US, due to lower service costs for the same
capacity.

Unfortunately, at this point it is diﬃcult to directly
compare user demand in each market due to the large
diﬀerences in service capacities. Therefore, we group users
into diﬀerent tiers of service based on their service capacity.
We then compare usage within the same tier across markets.
For this analysis, we selected the following tiers: below
1 Mbps, 1 to 8 Mbps, 8 to 16 Mbps, 16 to 32 Mbps, and
above 32 Mbps. The selection of tiers was based on the
speeds common among the broadband technologies in our
dataset and the range of capacities in each country. In the
following plots, we do not include data on a particular tier
for a country with less than 30 users in our dataset.

Figure 8 shows the 95th percentile utilization of users,
categorized by the aforementioned speed tiers. Figure 8a
represents the utilization for users in the US. In this case, as
customers sign up for faster services, they tend to be using
less of the link during peak usage.

Note the higher link utilization in Botswana (Fig. 8b)
compared to the utilization on the same tier in the US. In
Botswana, the average 95th percentile link utilization was
80%; in the US, the average peak utilization was about 52%.

Figure 9: Average 95th percentile utilization for
users in each country across each speed tier.

Such a signiﬁcant diﬀerence could be explained by the much
higher costs of faster service levels in Botswana where, for
instance, a 2 Mbps plan costs about $200 (PPP) per month!
Figure 8c shows a similar, but less pronounced trend in
Saudi Arabia. The large majority of users in Saudi Arabia
have capacities around 4 Mbps, in the 1 to 8 Mbps download
throughput-rate range. Compared to broadband users in the
US on the same tier, we also ﬁnd higher utilization of the link
in Saudi Arabia,. Speciﬁcally, for users in the 1 to 8 Mbps
group, the median link utilization increases from about 43%
in the US to 60% in Saudi Arabia.

At the other end of the spectrum is Japan, shown in
Fig. 8d. Here we ﬁnd that,
for the majority of users,
links tend to be very under-utilized, with an average link
utilization of 10%. Overall, the fraction of the link utilized
is similar to the same tier in the US, though it is slightly
higher, on average, in the US.

In Botswana, for example, users with less than 1 Mbps
service used 410 kbps on average versus 286 kbps in the
same tier in the US. Additionally, Fig. 9 shows that the
demand on the network is 676 kbps (37%) higher in Saudi
Arabia than on the same tier in the US. In fact, the average
demand of the 8-16 Mbps tier in the US is only 39% higher
than the 1-8 Mbps tier in Saudi Arabia, but is 90% higher
than the 1-8 Mbps tier in the US. This diﬀerence supports
our belief that the relatively high price of Internet access in
the country, rather than user need, is preventing users in
this market from signing up for faster services.

32 Mbps use 830 kbps more than users on the same tier in
Japan. Despite the fact that the cost of broadband access
is similar in both Japan and the US, the availability of
faster services at a lower cost leads subscribers to sign up
for services that will be less heavily used. We examine this
trend in the next section. Figure 9 shows the average peak
demand for diﬀerent tiers in each country. We note that
in the US, demand increases on each tier, despite the fact
that the fraction of the link utilized decreased (shown in
Fig. 8a). We also ﬁnd that when comparing across markets
at the same capacity tier, in addition to having higher link
utilization, users in more expensive markets also tended to
have a higher total demand.

6. COST OF INCREASING CAPACITY

Subscribers select broadband service based on their needs,
the set of available plans and the plans’ prices. Thus, given
the diversity in service availability across markets, users
with similar needs will end up choosing diﬀerent broadband
services, depending on what is available. In this section, we
look at how the relative cost of alternative services impacts
user demand.

Beyond price, broadband service markets diﬀer in the
relative cost of upgrading services. For example, according
to our dataset of service plans, both Japan and the US
have similar prices of broadband access with a connection
of at least 1 Mbps costs less than $25 per month. The two
markets diﬀer, however, in service availability and the cost
of upgrading. In Japan, a 100 Mbps plan is considerably less
expensive than in the US ($40 per month instead of $115 per
month). Furthermore, in contrast to the US, the broadband
service market in Japan has more options with capacities
above 50 Mbps and fewer ﬁxed-line services below 10 Mbps.
It is clear that the cost of upgrading capacity, similar to
the cost of a particular service level, can have an impact on
a demand users impose on their service. To explore this, we
begin by generalizing the cost of increased capacity. To this
end, we collect all service plans for each country, perform a
linear regression analysis on each market, and measure the
correlation between capacity and price. We ﬁnd that, in the
majority of these markets (66%) there is a strong correlation
(> 0.8) between price and capacity and in 81% there is at
least moderate correlation (> 0.4).

In markets where there is weak or no correlation, price is
often aﬀected by other factors. For example, in Afghanistan,
it is possible to sign up for a dedicated (not shared)
DSL connection that is slower and more expensive than
alternatives,
lowering the correlation coeﬃcient between
price and capacity. Whether or not a service is wireless or
has a monthly traﬃc cap would also aﬀect the relationship
between price and capacity.

For markets where price and capacity are at least mod-
erately correlated (r > 0.4), we use the slope of the linear
regression line to estimate the cost of upgrades (the slope is
measured in monthly price per Mbps increase in capacity).
Figure 10 presents a CDF of the cost of increasing capacity
by 1 Mbps for all markets in our dataset.

For illustration, we note in the ﬁgure where a few
representative markets fall in the distribution. At the lower
end of the curve (less than $0.10 to upgrade), we ﬁnd regions
such as Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. Countries
such as Canada and the US are at slightly above $0.50 per

the monthly cost

where increasing capacity costs more than $1, $5,
and $10 per month for a 1 Mbps increase in capacity.
We split Asia into two subgroups, developed and
developing, given the diversity of economies within
the area.6

As shown in Fig. 10, increasing capacity by 1 Mbps tends
to cost less than $1 per month in developed countries but
can be well above $100 (PPP) in some developing countries
(e.g., Paraguay and Ivory Coast).7 Table 5 summarizes this
distribution by aggregated region, presenting the percentage
of countries, per region, where the cost of increasing capacity
by 1Mbps is above $1, $5 and %10 (PPP) per month. The
trends are strikingly clear – for 74% of the countries in Africa
and 43% of those in the Middle East, for instance, the costs
of an additional 1Mbps is above $10 per month.

To test for the impact of service upgrade on user demand
we deﬁne a new study. For this experiment, our hypothesis
(H) states that as the cost to upgrade increases, users are
less likely to upgrade and will have higher network demand
than users in markets where upgrading is cheaper. Our

will not aﬀect demand. We use the cost of upgrade to split
broadband markets into three classes: countries where the
cost of increasing a service by 1Mbps is (i) below $0.5, (ii)
between $0.5 and $1 and (iii) above $1.00 per Mbps.

We present the results of this experiment in Table 6,
for average demand with and without including BitTorrent
traﬃc. In general, increased upgrade prices do lead to higher
demand. It is clear that users in developing countries tend
to use more than similar users where faster service are more
readily accessible. In cases where our results are statistically
signiﬁcant, we can reject the null hypothesis, and assert that
the price of increasing capacity aﬀects demand. Our results
are inconclusive, i.e., p-value slightly higher than 0.05 when
comparing demand (without BitTorrent) between markets
where the cost of upgrade are ($0, $0.50] and ($0.50, $1.00].
We have already visited an example of the impact that
the cost of increasing capacity can have on (Figs. 8 and 9).
While both Japan and the US have similar monthly cost of
broadband access, the costs of increasing capacity is over
ﬁve times higher in the US explaining the observed higher
demand in the US.

7. CONNECTION QUALITY

Previous works have shown that poor connection quality
can have a negative impact on a user’s quality of expe-
rience [13].
In this last section, we explore the potential
impact that the quality of a connection, speciﬁcally latency
and packet loss, has on user demand.

We hypothesize that a suﬃciently poor quality of experi-
ence could lead to a decrease in demand on the broadband
service.
In the following paragraphs we test whether this
is true by studying the impact of both long latencies
and high packet loss rates. As we have done in our
previous comparisons, we study the eﬀects of these factors
by comparing users that are similar in terms of link capacity
and location. When testing the eﬀects of increased latency,
we require that average packet loss rates are similar between
matched users and vice versa.
7.1 Latency

We ﬁrst look at the impact of latency on user behavior.
In this case, our hypothesis (H) is that decreasing latency
will result in higher demand. Therefore, our null hypothesis

Table 7: Percentage of the time that decreasing
latency will result in higher 95th percentile usage
(without BitTorrent). Very high latency (over
512 ms) to the nearest NDT server appears to result
in lower demand than comparable users with lower
latencies.

in our dataset, grouped by location (India versus
the rest of our sample population, labelled “Other”).
“Web” represents each user’s median latency to ﬁve
of Alexa’s Top Sites from our 2014 dataset. “NDT”
represents the average latency to the nearest NDT
server. We include NDT data from 2014 that was
collected from the same set of users as the web 2014
data.

(H0) is that decreasing latency does not aﬀect demand and
the interaction will be random.

We present the results of the study in Table 7. The table
compares the peak demand (95th percentile usage when
BitTorrent is not active) of users with problematically high
latencies, above 512 ms in our dataset. Users are divided
among exponentially increasing sized bins; our control and
treatment groups in this case are the higher and lower
latency groups, respectively. The results show that there
is a signiﬁcant increase in usage when switching from very
high latency to any lower latency group, leading us to reject
the null hypothesis.

While the case of latency impacting demand is visible
in multiple countries, the impact of high-latency is clear
when focusing on users in India. In our previous analysis
broadband service plans, we ﬁnd that the cost to increase
capacity is similar in both the US and India (both are
within 25% of each other). The cost of broadband access,
however, is much higher in India ($67 versus $20). Thus, we
would expect usage to be higher in India. When comparing

Very high packet

users in India to users with similar capacities in the US, we
ﬁnd, surprisingly, that users in India tend to impose lower
demand 62% of the time (p-value < 0.001).

An analysis of NDT latencies shows that users in India
report much higher latencies to NDT servers than users
in other countries. The trends are not restricted to NDT
servers but can also be seen when looking at latencies to
the set of ﬁve globally popular websites: Facebook, Google,
Windows Live, Yahoo, and YouTube. Four of these websites
(Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Yahoo) accounted for the
top ﬁve most popular websites in India8 while Windows Live
was ranked 26th.

Figure 11 describes these latency measurements, and
compares them by user location (India versus the rest of our
sample population). The lines labelled “Web” correspond
to the median latency to the ﬁve popular websites while
“NDT” is the average latency to the nearest NDT server
(measured by NDT). We include data from two time periods
– 2011 through 2013 (labelled “’11-’13”) and from May 2014
to August 2014 (labelled “’14”) to compare NDT and website
latencies. 9

Figure 11 shows that the distribution of latency measure-
ments is similar for both NDT traces and the typical latency
to the top Alexa sites. For the majority of users in India,
we ﬁnd much higher latencies to both NDT and popular
websites compared to the rest of our sample population;
nearly every user has a latency longer than 100 ms. Since
we rejected the null hypothesis that latency does does not
aﬀect demand, we believe that the higher latency for users
in India contributes to the fact that we see a decrease in
network usage in India.
7.2 Packet loss

Next we examine the impact of packet loss on user
demand. Our hypothesis (H) is that decreased packet loss
rates result in higher demand. The results of this experiment
are shown in Table 8. We ﬁnd that when comparing users
with very low packet loss rates to comparable users with
very high packet loss rates, usage tended to be higher
on connections with lower packet loss rates. This trend
was most pronounced when comparing to connections with
packet loss rates above 1%.

This impact of packet loss can be illustrated by looking at
the behavior of users in India, as done in Sec. 7.1. We again
found that users in India had much higher packet loss rates
than the general population, as shown in Fig 12. As a result,
we believe that the lower quality connections (both increased

packet loss rates and latency) in India are the probable cause
of lower demand on the network.

8. RELATED WORK

Broadband analysis has recently attracted much attention
from the research community and the general public given
its important business and policy implications. A number
of eﬀorts have focused on characterizing the availability and
performance of broadband services around the world [1, 2,
5, 12, 20, 28, 31, 33]. The focus of our work is on exploring
broadband services in their broader context, evaluating the
complex interplay between broadband service characteris-
tics, their market features and user demand.

Diﬀerent aspects of the complex interplay between user
behavior, network services and operation has been explore
in previous work. Some recent studies have examined the
relationship between user behavior, network services and
the providers. In Dobrian et al. [13] the authors show that
poor connection quality can have a negative impact on a
user’s quality of experience. Blackburn et al. [3] study how
user behavior aﬀects the economics of cellular operators.
Chetty et al. [7] perform a user study to understand the
eﬀects of usage caps on broadband use. Other eﬀorts
have explored additional factors that may inﬂuence service
demand, including the weather [6], service capacity [36] and
the type of region [8].

The diﬃculty or outright impossibility of conducting con-
trolled, randomized experiments of user behavior at Internet
scale has been pointed out before. In his SIGCOMM 2011
Award presentation, Vern Paxson pointed to this issue
and suggested the use of natural experiments to explore
potential causal relationships with observational data.
In
a recent paper, Krishnan and Sitaraman [21] explore the
use of related quasi-experimental design (QED) to evaluate
the impact of video stream quality on viewer behavior and
Oktay et al. [24] relies on it for causal analysis of user
behavior in social media. We opted for natural experiments,
rather than QED, as we consider the control and treatment
groups to be suﬃciently similar to random assignment.

The ﬁndings reported in this paper represent an import
step towards understanding how user behavior, and the

and the Internet at large. These ﬁndings should pro-
vide valuable insight to the research community, network
operators and policy makers. For policy makers, there
is a growing consensus that broadband access should be
treated as a fundamental right and several eﬀorts around
the world are aimed at closing the digital gap. We believe
that understanding digital inequality requires us to place
broadband access in a broader context [22]. This work, to
the best of our knowledge, is the ﬁrst attempt to that end.
In our longitudinal study of usage between 2011 and
2013, we found that subscribers’ demand remained relatively
constant in a particular service class, despite the fourfold
increase in global IP traﬃc over the past ﬁve years. Thus,
we believe the growth in broadband traﬃc comes from a
combination of increased service capacities and a rapidly
increasing number of broadband subscribers, rather than
higher demand at users’ existing service levels.

We ﬁnd a strong correlation between service capacity and
user demand, despite the fact that users rarely fully utilize
their links. We used two study designs to infer causality
between capacity and usage by studying how individual
users change behavior when switching to faster services
and by comparing demand between users with diﬀerent
capacities that are otherwise similar. Their relationship
also follows a law of diminishing returns;
in both cases,
we observed relatively lower increases in demand at higher
capacities. This trend is particularly noticeable at approx-
imately 10 Mbps, where usage begins to plateau for many
users.

This suggest that as service capacities continue to in-

crease, network operators can plan on higher over-provisioning
rates. We did observe, however, larger increases in demand
when including BitTorrent traﬃc in our analysis. Beyond
capacity, we also showed the impact that the quality of
a connection,
in terms of latency and packet loss rates,
has on user demand. For instance, we note that very
long latencies (above 500 ms) and high packet loss rates
(starting at 0.1%) clearly result in lower network usage. We
speculate that the relationship between capacity, quality and
demand will evolve with technology improvements and new
applications with greater bandwidth requirements become
widely available (e.g. 4k video streaming or telemedicine).

We examined how the price of broadband access aﬀect
user demand by comparing the behavior of users with
similar broadband services located in diﬀerent markets. We
found that users in markets where broadband connections
or additional capacity was more expensive, were more likely
to impose higher bandwidth demands on their service than
subscribers of comparable services in less expensive markets.
For policy makers, this would imply that a focus on wider
access to a medium, high-quality capacity service (around
10 Mbps) may have a more signiﬁcant impact than a focus
on increased service capacity. For operators, these trends
may suggest a possible role for service pricing in network
planning.

10. CONCLUSION

This paper is a ﬁrst attempt at understanding broadband
networks in their broader context, exploring the complex
interplay between broadband service characteristics and
user behavior. We combine data on broadband usage
with relative broadband service pricing from around the

world, and use alternative experimental designs to move
beyond correlation analysis in our study of the relationship
between user demand, broadband service retail prices, and
connection characteristics.

There are a number of interesting research directions
ahead, from further exploration of the interactions between
market features and usage, to an expanded analysis cap-
turing other contextual factors (from the weather and social
events to economics). For instance, investigating the relative
inﬂuence of levels of economic development or diﬀerences in
broadband availability in rural and urban areas, will give
us a more detailed understanding of the impact of diﬀerent
market features. Leveraging longitudinal data on broadband
usage, it may be possible to explore the potential beneﬁts
of national broadband deployment plans [4], both on the
market and on user behaviors. Finally, we have so far
treated users as a homogeneous consumer group; it will be
interesting to investigate how diﬀerent categories of users
(e.g., gamers, shoppers or movie-watchers) or more diverse
households are impacted by diﬀerent market and service
features.
