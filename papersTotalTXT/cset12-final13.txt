Abstract

Smart grids are susceptible to cyber-attack as a result
of new communication, control and computation tech-
niques employed in the grid. In this paper, we charac-
terize and analyze the resiliency of smart grid communi-
cation architecture, speciﬁcally an RF mesh based archi-
tecture, under cyber attacks. We analyze the resiliency of
the communication architecture by studying the perfor-
mance of high-level smart grid functions such as meter-
ing, and demand response which depend on communica-
tion. Disrupting the operation of these functions impacts
the operational resiliency of the smart grid. Our analysis
shows that it takes an attacker only a small fraction of
meters to compromise the communication resiliency of
the smart grid. We discuss the implications of our result
to critical smart grid functions and to the overall security
of the smart grid.

1 Introduction

Utilizing new communication, control and computation
technologies in the modern smart grid can enhance the
reliability of the smart grid, reduce electricity costs
and provide new real-time customer services [3, 7, 11].

For example, adding smart metering systems and other
devices to collect critical information from customer
premises will assist power utilities in better decision-
making which improves the overall reliability of the
smart grid. A customer plugging in an electric vehicle
(EV) and programming it to charge during off-peak hours
is an example of how smart grid capabilities promise to
reduce electricity costs [3]. These enhancements also
create new cyber vulnerabilities that are exploitable by
malicious entities to disrupt smart grid operations at a
large scale. For example, some electric vehicles of-
fer a smart phone interface that enables remote control
over vehicle charging and discharging. An attacker gain-
ing malicious control of this interface for a large num-
ber of EVs can trigger simultaneous charging to create
peak loads on the power grid, eventually leading to a
large scale blackout [14]. As discussed by Pelechrinis
et al. [18], cyber attacks in the form of denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks can be trivially launched by malicious en-
tities against a wireless-based communication infrastruc-
ture. In the context of a smart grid, such attacks have po-
tential to disrupt smart grid functions such as smart me-
tering, demand response and outage management, thus
impacting its overall resiliency.

Our objective is to experimentally evaluate the re-
siliency of smart grid communication architectures un-
der cyber attacks by studying the performance of higher-
level functions dependent on it. We consider the RF
mesh as our choice of communication architecture. The
RF mesh architecture involves smart meters communi-
cating with each other over a wireless protocol. As dis-
cussed subsequently, the choice of communication archi-
tecture and its deployment impacts the overall resiliency
of the smart grid. Our focus here is on evaluating the re-
siliency of RF mesh-based communication architecture
for the smart grid under the presence of DoS attacks.

As shown in Figure 1, the smart grid can be logi-
cally decomposed into a physical power layer, a monitor-
ing and communication layer called Advanced Metering

Infrastructure (AMI), and an application layer consist-
ing of higher-level functions such as automated meter-
ing, outage management (OM), demand response (DR)
and automated charging/discharging of EVs. In addition
to the essential functional layers, there is a need for an
orthogonal cyber security layer (CS) for protecting the
system against failures and attacks and ensuring the in-
tegrity, conﬁdentiality and availability of the system. At
the lowest level of its operations, operational resilience
for a smart grid is the ability to deliver sustained power.
But, as shown in Figure 1 the resiliency of the overall
smart grid also depends on the resiliency of its higher-
level functions which in turn are directly dependent on
the resiliency of the AMI communication layer. We ob-
serve that a resilient smart grid design rests on a resilient
communication infrastructure.

In this work, we present a methodology to measure
impact of communication on the performance of higher-
level functions dependent on it. Our approach consists of
modeling an RF mesh communication network deployed
in a typical smart grid region, simulating the behavior
of higher-level smart grid functions and analyzing the
performance of those functions under a DoS attack on
the communication infrastructure. The results we found,
quantitatively demonstrate that the RF mesh is not re-
silient to the DoS attack as characterized in our work and
impacts performance of higher level functions that de-
pend on it. We hope that our results assist smart grid
architects in making informed design choices. We intend
our work as a ﬁrst step in designing a secure smart grid,
accounting for security as an important component of the
system architecture [13].

In the remainder of this paper, we provide an overview
of resiliency in the smart grid in Section 2, followed by
a detailed account of the experiments and results in Sec-
tion 3. Section 4 discusses the lessons learned, Section 5
discusses related work and we conclude with our contri-
butions and future work in Section 6.

2 Resilience

Resilience is the capability of a system to fulﬁll its mis-
sion in a timely manner, even in the presence of attacks
or failures. An operationally resilient system contin-
ues delivering essential services even under adverse op-
erating conditions and rapidly recovers its full services
when conditions improve. A number of factors such as
cyber attacks, internal system failures, policy changes,
conﬁguration changes, or deployment changes can re-
sult in adverse conditions and disrupt system operation.
We are speciﬁcally interested in analyzing the resiliency
of the smart grid under cyber attacks. Furthermore, as
discussed in Section 1, our focus is speciﬁcally on an-
alyzing the resiliency of the smart grid communication
layer. In the following subsections, we ﬁrst elaborate on

lowed by a discussion of our approach used to measure
resiliency.

2.1 Resiliency of Smart Grid Functions

In this section, we discuss four high-level smart grid
functions: remote metering, demand response, outage
management and cyber security, and discuss their re-
silience with respect to the underlying communication
architecture. Additionally, we discuss the minimum con-
ditions necessary for the functions to be resilient.

Remote Metering Automated remote metering re-
quires meters to send meter reads to the utility at a con-
ﬁgurable frequency. This function depends on reliable
and timely delivery of meter data to the utility by the
underlying AMI communication infrastructure. Long-
term disruption of the metering function impacts the op-
erational resiliency of the smart grid by interfering with
revenue. Remote metering is resilient if data from some
percentage of the meters is always delivered to the util-
ity and within a bounded time, where the percentage and
time are dependent on utility-speciﬁc requirements.

Demand Response (DR) DR is a critical component
of automated load management and relies on the abil-
ity of the AMI communication infrastructure to reliably
send load curtailment requests to smart meters and other
end devices for dynamically managing the overall sys-
tem load. DR signals to the Home Area Network (HAN)
could travel through the Internet or the AMI system,
but we only consider the latter. Unlike metering, dis-
ruption of DR operations can have near-term effects on
operational resiliency of the smart grid by destabiliz-
ing the power grid. Demand response is resilient if re-
quired kWh of load is always curtailed within a bounded
time, where the required load and time are dependent on
utility-speciﬁc requirements.

Outage Management (OM) Automated outage man-
agement requires smart meters to send outage informa-
tion in a last gasp message on detection of an outage by
the meter [5]. The utility uses the information such as
time and location of the outage from the message to re-

2

store power in a timely manner. A disruption of this func-
tion directly affects the operational resiliency of the grid
by delaying the recovery and restoration of power to end
customers. Outage management is resilient if the util-
ity can always identify and recover from outages within
a bounded time, where the time is dependent on utility-
speciﬁc requirements.

Cyber Security (CS) The cyber security component
protects the smart grid system against attacks and fail-
ures and provides integrity, availability and conﬁdential-
ity services for the smart grid. CS functions such detec-
tion, diagnosis and response depend on the underlying
communication infrastructure for tasks such as transport-
ing monitored data from different critical points in the
system, exchanging detection and diagnosis messages
across its components and communicating response ac-
tions for responding promptly to adverse situations. Dis-
ruption of these functions has direct consequences to
the security of the smart grid and impacts its overall re-
siliency. Cyber security component is resilient if it al-
ways detects and responds to security threats before per-
formance and security requirements of other functions
are violated.

2.2 Measuring and Analyzing Resiliency

Our approach to analyze the resiliency of the commu-
nication architecture under a cyber attack relies on mea-
suring the impact of the attack on performance of higher-
level functions. We capture the resiliency requirements
of high-level functions as low-level communication met-
rics and measure the low-level metrics under different
experiment scenarios.

Speciﬁcally, our simulation, discussed later in Sec-
tion 3, simulates the normal behavior of two functions,
namely, (a) automated metering, and (b) demand re-
sponse and measures the performance of those functions
during a cyber attack on the communication infrastruc-
ture. We choose only the automated metering and de-
mand response functions in our study as they are char-
acteristic of two typical behaviors, periodic and asyn-
chronous, seen on a smart grid.

Our attack scenario consists of an attacker taking ad-
vantage of the large scale deployment of meters within
the RF mesh to generate a DoS condition on the network
by simultaneously generating low bit-rate trafﬁc (hun-
dreds of kbits/s) from individual meters. Since the at-
tack is directly performed on the communication infras-
tructure, it causes legitimate packets belonging to higher-
level functions to be dropped or delayed which impacts
their performance and consequently their resiliency. We
analyze the performance of these higher-level functions
for different conﬁgurations of the communication archi-
tecture, discussed later in Section 3.5. A resilient com-
munication architecture is one which sustains the cyber

attack without compromising the performance require-
ments of the higher-level functions.

We deﬁne four metrics to measure the impact of the
attack on the performance of higher-level functions. For
purposes of this work and the deﬁnitions below, we as-
sume the sender to be a customer-side device such as a
smart meter and the receiver to be a node such as the data
collector node within a smart grid region.
Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) deﬁned as the number of
packets successfully received by a receiver over the
expected number of packets.

Average End-to-end Delay deﬁned as the average time
taken for packets to be transmitted from the sending
application to the receiving application.

Average Packet Hop Count deﬁned as

the average
number of intermediate nodes through which the
packets sent by a sender are routed.
In the case
of an RF mesh-based network,
the average hop
count measures the number of meters traversed by a
packet before it reaches the receiver.

Successful DR Requests Ratio deﬁned as the number
of DR requests that successfully receive a reply over
the total DR requests that were issued.

The ﬁrst three metrics measure performance of the
metering function while the last metric applies to DR.
The above metrics are not unique to our work and have
been previously used by other researchers to measure re-
siliency in different domains. Liu et al. [10] deﬁne net-
work resilience as the percentage of lost trafﬁc upon fail-
ures. Cholda et al. [2] deﬁne network resilience as gen-
eral ability to improve network fault tolerance and re-
liability. Metrics derived from dependability attributes
of systems like availability and performance have also
been proposed to quantify resilience. For example, Liu
et al. [10] use packet loss rate and Najjar et al. [12] use
packet loss rate and packet delay to quantify resiliency
in their work. Lee et al. [8] quantify the resilience of
a system under DoS attack by the amount of trafﬁc that
needs to be sent to the system to make it unavailable.
Our choice of metrics is due to our approach based on
measuring performance of higher-level functions.

3 Methodology

Our overall goal is to design security components for the
smart grid and our simulations described in this section
are a step in that direction. Speciﬁcally, modeling and
simulating the system at the early stages will help us (1)
know the realistic attack scenarios that can interrupt the
operation of the smart grid, and (2) know the realistic im-
pacts achieved by those attacks [23]. We intend to use the
knowledge derived from such simulations to build cyber
security solutions for the smart grid in the future. In this
section, we ﬁrst discuss our high-level design choices for
the experiment, followed by the details of the experiment

Meter Conﬁguration We conﬁgure each meter in
the region with the following parameters derived from
speciﬁcations of a real smart meter [21]:
radio fre-
quency = 900 MHz, data rate = 100 kbits/s,
trans-
mitter output = 30 dBm (1 Watt), receiver sensitiv-
ity = −97 dBm.

Meter Distribution We use the region shown in Fig-
ure 2, to make an informed guess about the meter coor-
dinates. The chosen region allows placing meters uni-
formly and placing the collector at the center of the re-
gion.

Propagation Model We conﬁgure the ns-2 simulator
to simulate an outdoor “shadowed urban area” using the
shadowing propagation model with the following param-
eters: path loss exponent = 2.7, standard deviation = 4,
reference distance = 1 m.

3.3 Simulation of Smart Grid Functions

We simulate behavior of two smart grid functions: (a) au-
tomated, periodic meter reads from meters, and (b) DR
load curtailment signals. For metering, we assume that
all meters send their meter reads to the central collector,
where each meter read is 1000 bytes, according to a pre-
conﬁgured sending interval set by the utility. For DR, we
simulate sending of a DR load curtailment signal from
the collector to a group of enrolled homes requesting that
they curtail certain amount of load. We assume that only
20% of the smart meters register in the DR program to
receive DR requests from the utility. Upon receipt of a
DR request, the smart meter immediately responds by
sending a DR reply to the collector.

3.4 Denial-of-service Attack

We assume that an attacker wants to generate a DoS at-
tack targeting the collector in a certain RF mesh. The
attack takes advantage of the large number of meters
within the geographical region to generate a DoS on the
collector node by simultaneously generating low bit-rate
trafﬁc (hundreds of kbits/s) from individual meters. Re-
alistically, an attacker can accomplish this attack using
different means, for example, an attacker could compro-
mise smart meters in a certain RF mesh and reprogram
them to increase the frequency at which they send meter
reads. Or, an attacker could take control of other cus-
tomer devices such as the service gateway within a HAN
to send spurious trafﬁc creating a DoS attack.

In our experiment, we simulate a DoS attack by as-
suming that an attacker compromises some fraction of
the meters within the region and reprograms them to send
spurious meter reads at a higher frequency. As discussed
later in Section 3.5, we control the effect of the DoS, that
is, the amount of trafﬁc in the network, by varying the
meter sending intervals between 20 s to 60 s.

3.1 Choice of Experimentation Platform:

Simulation vs. Emulation

A key challenge in this work involved choosing an ap-
propriate experimentation platform given that we had to
faithfully model a wireless RF mesh with hundreds of
wireless nodes and different wireless protocols. Our op-
tions involved either using a simulator such as ns-2 [15]
or a network testbed such as DETER [1].

DETER is a wired network testbed and allows using
real nodes and links to create a network but, it does not
directly support creating wireless networks. Using a tool
like SWOON [4], one can emulate wireless nodes on
DETER but it does not scale to hundreds of nodes since
simulating a wireless node requires two physical nodes.
ns-2 is a widely used network simulator, has support
for a variety of wireless protocols and scales well to the
situations needed to model the smart grid. Although,
DETER allows us to emulate the real smart meter nodes,
using real software if available, and can generate real net-
work trafﬁc, this is not a requirement for us, since we are
only concerned with the network-level behavior of the
meters. Our choice of platform for this work is thus ns-
2.

3.2 Experiment Topology

We model a real geographical region, shown in Figure 2,
in ns-2. Each house shown in the ﬁgure represents a real
smart meter node and they communicate with a collector,
represented by a star, located at the center of the region.
The collector is responsible for relaying packets between
the meters in the RF mesh and the utility through the
Wide Area Network (WAN).

3.5 Experiment Procedure and Results

Baseline Experiment

Our high-level procedure involves ﬁrst running experi-
ments under normal operating conditions, that is, without
any DoS attack to determine a baseline experiment con-
ﬁguration. We then use the parameters from the baseline
conﬁguration to study the resiliency of the communica-
tion architecture and the performance of functions under
the DoS attack discussed in Section 3.4.

An experiment conﬁguration is a set of parameters
controlling a particular experiment run and deﬁned us-
ing three parameters: i) the routing protocol (R) used in
the RF mesh, ii) the number of smart meter nodes (N) in
the RF mesh network, and iii) the sending interval of the
meters (I).

An experiment run consists of all N meters conﬁgured
to use the routing protocol R, with each meter sending its
readings periodically at the conﬁgured sending interval
I. Each meter starts sending its data at a time (T ) chosen
from a uniform random distribution (T ∼ U(0, I)). Addi-
tionally, the collector initiates DR requests to 20% of the
N meter nodes. We collect the results for three reading
cycles, that is, three sending intervals.

To ﬁnd a baseline experiment conﬁguration, we run ex-
periments by varying the choice of routing protocol,
the number of meters, and meters’ sending intervals,
and record the performance metrics discussed in Sec-
tion 2.2. We considered three RF mesh routing proto-
cols: Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) [19],
Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) [6] and Destination Se-
quenced Distance Vector (DSDV) [20]. Our initial simu-
lations for comparing protocol performance showed that
on-demand routing protocols like AODV and DSR out-
perform the proactive routing protocol DSDV by impos-
ing less overhead on the network. We thus only consider
AODV and DSR for determining the baseline experiment
conﬁguration. We vary the number of meters within the
region starting from 150 to 350 in 50 meters step. Fi-
nally, we vary the sending intervals as 60, 420, 900 and
1800 s.

We discuss our results for the baseline conﬁguration,
choosing AODV as the routing protocol and omit the re-
sults using DSR due to space limitations. In brief, we
observed that DSR performed badly compared to AODV
as the number of meters increased for all monitored met-
rics.

Figure 4: Plots of performance metrics with the network under an active DoS attack. The experiment conﬁguration is the baseline conﬁguration
of 250 meters, meter sending interval set to 900 s, and the routing protocol as AODV. Each X-axis entry represents (percentage of compromised
meters)-(sending interval of the compromised meters in seconds).

Figure 3 shows the simulation results of using AODV
as the routing protocol and varying the other two exper-
iment conﬁguration parameters: number of meters and
sending interval. The X-axis for each graph in Figure 3
represents a combination of number of meters and send-
ing interval (number of meters)-(sending interval). We
observe that performance is bad for the 60 s sending in-
terval starting from 150 meters, that is, PDR is 7.33%,
average packets end-to-end delay is 22.42 s and average
hop count is 2.33. Only 6.66% of the DR requests re-
ceived a reply. We do not show the results for sending
interval = 60 s and number of meters ≥ 250 as the PDR
was 0.0%.

Ideally, utilities would dictate the requirements for
choosing an acceptable baseline conﬁguration. Our
method for choosing a baseline conﬁguration relies on
identifying the conﬁguration values that result in high
percentage of successful DR transaction, followed by a
high packet delivery ratio, a low average end-to-end de-
lay and ﬁnally a low average packet hop count. Using
the above criteria and using Figure 3, we identify an
acceptable conﬁguration with number of meters = 250
and sending interval = 900 s, that is, a conﬁguration for
which PDR is 97.07%, average packet end-to-end delay

is 2.86 s, average hop count is 2.28 and 100% of DR re-
quests received a reply.

We want to emphasize here that we are not trying to
ﬁnd the best conﬁguration for the RF mesh, but instead
we try to ﬁnd an acceptable conﬁguration with which we
can simulate the attack. For example, we understand that
some routing protocols such as PRL [24] are more suit-
able for the RF mesh network and we plan to use these
in our future simulations.

Experiment with DoS Attack

Our experiment conﬁguration for the DoS attack consists
of the AODV routing protocol, 250 meters, and 900 s
sending interval for meters. The DoS attack assumes that
the attacker has managed to comprise Y% of smart me-
ters (uniformly distributed in the region) and has repro-
grammed their sending interval to Z seconds. Figure 4
summarizes the results of the experiment. Each entry on
the X-axis in Figure 4 represents a combination Y-Z.

We measure the same performance parameters as for
the baseline case under the attack scenario. The results
are as shown in Figure 4. We observe that for Y = 10%
and Z = 60 s the percentage of successfully received
packets drops from 97.07% to 65.45%. The average

6

packets end-to-end delay increases from 2.85 to 4.02 s.

Utilities may require the packet hop count in the RF
mesh to be within a threshold so as to place determin-
istic bounds on the latency experienced by meters in a
large network. As we lack the details for such a require-
ment, we do not enforce it in the simulation. We observe
that enforcing such a requirement would further degrade
the performance with respect to PDR and successful DR
requests ratio when the network is under a DoS attack.

4 Lessons Learned

Analysis of the kind discussed in our work helps in un-
derstanding the attack scenarios that disrupt the opera-
tion of the communication architecture and the realistic
impacts of those attacks on high-level smart grid func-
tions.

We summarize our key ﬁnding as follows: It requires
an attacker to compromise only a small fraction of the
meters in a typical RF mesh region to disrupt the com-
munication resilience within the region.

Speciﬁcally, we see from Figure 4 that a compromise
of about 5% of the 250 meters was sufﬁcient to reduce
the PDR to 10% and the successful DR request ratio to
zero. Although these ﬁgures apply to a single RF mesh
region, we observe that given the cyber nature of the at-
tack, an attacker can easily scale-up this attack by repli-
cating it over multiple RF mesh regions. We discuss the
implications of our result to key smart grid functions in
subsequent paragraphs.

Remote Metering Utilities expect to receive a certain
percentage of meter reads per reading cycle and within
a bounded time. Missing meter reads from meters may
not be severe as far as billing operations are concerned
but the periodic meter reads are also used in a contin-
uous manner as an input to important demand response
functions such as load monitoring and forecasting. Dis-
ruption of these continuous inputs has consequences for
the stability of the overall power grid thereby impacting
its resilience.

Demand Response DR functionality depends on the
ability to successfully curtail load within a bounded
time period. This requires DR requests to be success-
fully communicated and acknowledged within a bounded
time. As we observe from Figure 4, attacks can cause
successful DR transactions (request-response pairs) to
reduce to zero. With additional simulations, results of
which are not included due to space limitations, we found
that the average round trip time (RTT) for messages in-
creased approximately 35 times during an attack (RTT
was 0.11 s for the baseline case and around 4 s during an
attack, for 5% compromised meters and 30 s sending in-
terval). This again shows that attackers can easily disrupt
the automated load management functions in the smart

grid which can eventually lead to consequences such as
large-scale blackouts.

Cyber Security Given that an attacker needs to com-
promise only a small fraction of meters to launch a DoS
attack, cyber security functions at the utility may not be
able to detect and characterize the impact of the attack
immediately and thus result in a delayed response. In ad-
dition, the DoS attack could disrupt critical meter events
from reaching the utility which could add additional de-
lays to detection and response.

Overall, in this work, we have quantitatively demon-
strated through simulation, the effects of a cyber attack
on the resiliency of the RF mesh communication archi-
tecture and its impact on the performance of two key
higher-level functions of automated metering and de-
mand response. An important implication of our work
is that an improperly conﬁgured and improperly secured
smart grid communication architecture, can lend itself to
simple DoS attacks thereby compromising the resiliency
of the overall smart grid.

5 Related Work

Researchers have used alternative simulation approaches
to study the RF mesh architecture but our work differs
with previous approaches on the objectives, scale and
level of resolution of the experiments. The Smart Grid
Communication Assessment Tool (SG-CAT) [17], de-
veloped on top of OPNET Modeler [16], evaluates the
communication capabilities of RF mesh under different
deployments but not under cyber attack scenarios. The
CLEVER simulator [22] evaluated the impact of differ-
ent communication technologies such as PLC, broad-
band, GPRS on the performance of AMI communica-
tion for large-scale scenarios. Licht et al.
evaluated
the predeployment performance of an RF mesh using the
OMNeT++ simulator [9] and tested different design op-
tions such as message frequency to ﬁnd a proper deploy-
ment conﬁguration.
In summary, most of the encoun-
tered work focused on evaluation of smart grid commu-
nication capabilities during normal operations whereas
our objective was to study the resiliency of smart grid
communications in the presence of cyber attacks.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In our work, we experimentally studied the resiliency of
a smart grid communication architecture, speciﬁcally the
RF mesh, in the presence of DoS attack. We quantita-
tively demonstrated that it requires an attacker to com-
promise only a small fraction of meters to violate the
resilience of the communication architecture and conse-
quently the overall resiliency of the smart grid.

Our next step involves using the knowledge from our
simulations to build cyber security solutions for mitigat-

7

ing the threats to communication architectures. We also
need to (a) test and validate the basic implementation and
operation of our cyber security solution with respect to
its design goals, and (b) test the performance of the entire
smart grid system under different scenarios to ensure that
the system performance is within acceptable limits. We
observe that modeling the smart grid using simulators
is insufﬁcient to capture behavior of real software and
hardware components and requires using testbed-based
environments like DETER. But, at the same time, simu-
lators such as ns-2 allow us to rapidly prototype large-
scale scenarios to gather quick understanding of gen-
eral behaviors. For example, simulations can help us
generate trafﬁc traces for emulating aggregate behavior
of an RF mesh network on a testbed. This is impor-
tant in a nascent domain like smart grid where there is
a lack of real world traces. We are actively investigat-
ing approaches to integrate the simulation and emulation
approaches for modeling large-scale cyber-physical sys-
tems such as the smart grid.
