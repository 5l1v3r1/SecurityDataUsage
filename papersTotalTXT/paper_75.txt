Abstract. We present the ﬁrst empirical analysis of Bitcoin-based scams: oper-
ations established with fraudulent intent. By amalgamating reports gathered by
voluntary vigilantes and tracked in online forums, we identify 192 scams and cat-
egorize them into four groups: Ponzi schemes, mining scams, scam wallets and
fraudulent exchanges. In 21% of the cases, we also found the associated Bitcoin
addresses, which enables us to track payments into and out of the scams. We ﬁnd
that at least $11 million has been contributed to the scams from 13 000 distinct
victims. Furthermore, we present evidence that the most successful scams depend
on large contributions from a very small number of victims. Finally, we discuss
ways in which the scams could be countered.

Introduction

An effective, though unfortunate, way to determine that a new technological platform
has “arrived” is by observing the presence of scammers leeching off those using the
system. Shortly after the advent of the telegraph, sneaky punters began placing bets on
recently-completed horse races at faraway bookmakers who had not yet observed the
result [1]. Once telephones became pervasive, unsolicited calls by scammers became
problematic. No sooner had email become popular, then a ﬂood of messages promising
riches from Nigerian princes began ﬁlling people’s inboxes.

In this paper, we investigate scams targeting the virtual currency Bitcoin, which has
exploded in popularity since its introduction in 2009 [2]. As more people have been
drawn to Bitcoin, frequently out of a desire to get rich quickly, more hucksters have
appeared to take advantage of these eager new targets. Because Bitcoin is so new, the
newly emerging scams are frequently poorly understood. The goal of this paper is to
systematically investigate different types of Bitcoin scams, explain how they work, and
measure their prevalence. It is hoped that by understanding how these scams work we
will identify ways to arrest their rise.

To that end, we identify four types of scams currently plaguing Bitcoin: high-yield
investment programs, mining investment scams, scam wallet services and scam ex-
changes. Using reports obtained from discussion forums and tracking websites, we
study 41 distinct scams operational between 2011 and 2014 where we could ﬁnd the
associated Bitcoin address(es). So while the study is by no means comprehensive, we
are able to analyze the block chain and provide a lower bound estimate of the prevalence
and criminal proﬁts associated with these scams.

We ﬁnd that $11 million worth of bitcoin has been contributed to the scams, and that
at most $4 million has been returned to the victims. For the HYIPs and mining scams,
we estimate that about 13 000 victims contributed funds. We also show that the most
successful scams draw the vast majority of their revenue from a few victims, presenting
an opportunity for law enforcement to track down and prosecute the scammers.

Section 2 describes the methodology for identifying scams, as well as how we ex-
amine the block chain to identify payments into and out of scams. Section 3 reports
on high-yield investment programs (HYIPs), online Ponzi schemes where existing in-
vestors are paid lucrative returns from the contributions of new investors. Section 4 ex-
amines mining-investment scams, which is a form of advanced-fee fraud that exploits
people’s interest in Bitcoin mining by promising a way to proﬁtably mine without mak-
ing large up-front investments in expensive hardware. Sections 5 and 6 cover scam
wallets and exchanges, respectively. Here, the scammers provide sought-after services
such as mixing at a seemingly affordable price, only to steal incoming transfers from
customers. Section 7 compares the different scam categories and considers what the
appropriate response, if any, should be from the Bitcoin community and policymakers.
Finally, we review related work in Section 8 and conclude in Section 9.

2 Methodology for Identifying Scams and Associated Transactions

We compile a list of 349 distinct candidate scams from an aggregated thread
on bitcointalk.org1, a blacklist of suspected fraudulent services maintained
at http://www.badbitcoin.org/thebadlist/index.htm, and a website
tracking Bitcoin-based HYIPs called cryptohyips.com2. We manually inspected
all services on the list to identify only those operations established with fraudulent in-
tent. For instance, we exclude Hashfast, a mining company that recently ﬁled for Chap-
ter 11 bankruptcy protection, as well as losses from Mt. Gox, a bitcoin exchange that
failed. We also removed a number of false positives with no clear connection to cryp-
tocurrencies, such as unclechiens.com (a Chinese restaurant in Texas). In total,
this sheds 26% of our candidate list.

We also exclude from consideration all efforts beyond the purview of this paper,
such as phishing websites, malware websites, and pay-for-click websites. We are left
with 192 scams to investigate further, 55% of the candidates. We categorize each scam’s
type by inspecting the website through the Internet Archive (since many scams have
since disappeared) and targeted Google searches on the domain.

We next seek out associated Bitcoin addresses for each scam using threads on
bitcointalk.org, reddit.com/r/bitcoin, and named addresses and trans-
actions on blockchain.info. We exclude any “dual-use” addresses that are also
used for other purposes. In all, we ﬁnd usable Bitcoin addresses for 20% of the scams.
The next goal is to identify payments made into and out of the scam. To that end,
we download the Bitcoin block chain using the Bitcoin Core client on August 25, 2014.
Using znort987’s Bitcoin blockparser [3] we query for all transactions involving our
set of scammy addresses. This gives us trafﬁc levels for incoming transactions to each

scam. We then take a complete SQL dump of the Bitcoin block chain and query for all
the transactions where the input or output address match one of our scam addresses.
This gives us the Bitcoin addresses of the victims as well as the outgoing transactions
from the scam. To separate out transactions made by scammers, we omit all outgoing
transactions going to other addresses associated with the same scam. We also omit
transactions occurring before and after the ﬁrst incoming transaction to the scam.

One challenge for researchers inspecting a block chain is dealing with multiple
sources and destinations in transactions. Figure 1 demonstrates the three cases where
these transactions arise. We deal with multiple source–single destination transactions
(Figure 1 (left)) as follows. If the destination is a scam address and the source addresses
are not also identiﬁed as being part of the scam, we group the source addresses together
as a single victim.3 In general, two addresses are assigned to the same address group
if they ever paid into the same scam during the same transaction. For multiple-source
transactions involving a scam address, we only count the scam address’s contribution
towards the total payout from the scam.

For transactions with a single source and multiple destinations (Figure 1 (center)),
we attribute only the source amount to the scam. For instance, suppose Fig is a victim
address and Honeydew is the scam. Even though Fig pays 0.4 BTC, we tally only the
0.32 BTC transferred to Honeydew as part of the scam’s total incoming payments.

With multiple sources and destinations (Figure 1 (right)), we assign the amount paid
in or out of the scam to the corresponding address group. For example, suppose Lemur
is the scam address. Here, the victim group Koala–Jaguar–Iguana contributes 1.6 BTC
to Lemur’s scam. While in theory services such as CoinJoin [4] could account for many
such transactions, in practice we do not observe very many transactions of this type.

Finally, we note that when identifying victim groups we could mistakenly identify
online web wallets that pay out multiple users from the same address as a single ad-
dress group. To check for this, we inspected all multiple-destination transactions whose
source address appeared more than three times. In all cases, we did not ﬁnd that the
source addresses corresponded to web wallets. One potential explanation for this is that
many scams prohibit using web wallets as a method of payment.

In addition to gathering data directly from the blockchain, we also analyze scams
that raise funds through selling shares. We gather the share holdings from BitFunder and
cross list that with cost of the shares from announcements on bitcointalk.org.
For each scam, we omit the top holding who we verify is the scammer in all instances.

3 Note that we deliberately make no attempt to deanonymize the actual victims beyond identi-
fying that the addresses participated in the scam.

Table 1: For each scam category, we report whether we can directly observe transactions
corresponding to what victims pay into scams, what is paid out to victims, and what is
paid out to the scammer (indicated by a (cid:88)).

Ideally, we would analyze payments from victims into scams, payments back to vic-
tims, and scammer proﬁts. For some scams, we can observe all such payments, whereas
for others we can only observe certain categories. Table 1 summarizes the types of ob-
servable transactions for each scam type. Full details are given in subsequent sections.
Finally, due to high volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate, it makes sense to also
report scam revenues in terms of its dollar equivalent. In order to convert BTC to USD,
we gathered the daily closing USD-BTC exchange rate from the four highest-volume
USD exchanges during the period of our study (Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, Bitﬁnex and BTC-
E), as reported to http://www.bitcoincharts.com. We then converted any
transactions into USD using the average exchange rate on the day of the transaction.

3 High Yield Investment Programs

Moore et al. ﬁrst described high-yield investment programs (HYIPs) in [5]. HYIPs are
online Ponzi schemes where people are promised outlandish interest rates on deposits
(e.g., 1–2% interest per day). Unsurprisingly, the schemes eventually collapse, and they
are replaced by new programs often run by the same criminals. Moore et al. observed
that these HYIP schemes relied on virtual currencies such as Liberty Reserve, Per-
fect Money, and EuroGoldCash for deposits and withdrawals. The centralized nature of
these particular currencies has left them vulnerable to countermeasures by law enforce-
ment. For example, Liberty Reserve was taken down by the US government in 2013
for money-laundering activities. In response, some programs have begun accepting de-
centralized digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. Furthermore, most HYIPs
directly advertise Bitcoin addresses in order to accept incoming payments, as opposed
to using a payment processor such as BitPay or Coinbase.

We observe a number of different types of HYIPs that accept Bitcoin: HYIPs that
stay in the traditional HYIP ecosystem; HYIPs that bridge the traditional HYIP ecosys-
tem and the Bitcoin community; and HYIPs that originate in the Bitcoin ecosphere.

3.1 Traditional HYIPs

We ﬁrst investigated the extent to which traditional HYIPs have begun to embrace Bit-
coin. To our surprise, we found that most HYIPs do not accept bitcoin as payment.
We believe the reason why is that the leading kit for developing HYIP websites, Gold

Coders, does not support payments in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Neisius and
Clayton analyzed the HYIP ecosystem, and they estimated that between 50–80% of
HYIP websites they observed used the Gold Coders kit [6].

When we observed several “aggregator” websites that track HYIPs, we found some
traditional HYIPs that accept BTC or LTC. We then inspected HYIPs with a publicly-
accessible incoming address but had never been mentioned on bitcointalk.org.
All of these programs had insigniﬁcant transaction volume. Based on these ﬁndings, we
do not consider traditional HYIPs further in our analysis.

3.2 Bridge HYIPs

Some scams ﬁrst appear in the traditional HYIP ecosystem before being brought over to
the Bitcoin world through posts on bitcointalk.org. In these cases we frequently
ﬁnd a high volume of BTC transactions. For example, Leancy claimed to have received
over $5M in investments4 from a variety of currencies. From observing payments into
its Bitcoin address, we estimate $1 674 270 came from bitcoin deposits.

Overall, we observe a total of nine such scams that brought in 12 622 BTC ($6.5M)
from September 2, 2013 through September 9, 2014. Table 2 reports key summary
statistics for the nine bridge HYIPs observed. Median lifetime of the bridge HYIPs is
125 days, with one HYIP still in operation at the time of writing.

The $6.5M in contributions came from 9 410 distinct address groups, which pro-
vides an upper bound for the number of victims contributing to these scams. The scams
in turn paid at most $3.5M back to the victims, leaving $3M in proﬁt to the operators.
It is likely that at least some of the $3.5M in payouts went to addresses controlled by
scammers, so we expect the actual proﬁt rate to be much higher.

These summary statistics obscure the details of how individual scams performed
over time. Figure 2 (top) plots the aggregate payments into and out of the nine bridge

HYIPs. We can see that, in aggregate, the payments ﬂowing into the scams always keep
pace with the payments ﬂowing out. We also see huge spikes in the money ﬂowing in
at different points throughout the period, with nearly all of the activity taking place in
2014. Figure 2 (bottom) breaks out the incoming payments to the associated scams.
We can see that the ﬁrst big spike is due to the rise of Leancy, the second Cryptory,
the third Rockwell Partners and the fourth Cryptory (with a small contribution form
Rockwell Partners). Hence the overall burstiness observed in the scam contributions can
be attributed to different scams receiving a surge of investment before falling rapidly.

Figure 3 compares the transactions in and out for the top 8 performing bridge
HYIPs. The graphs are presented in decreasing order of scam size, and the graph
also includes a green dotted line indicating the day the scam ﬁrst appeared on the
bitcointalk.org forum.

For example, for Leancy (top right) we see the ﬁrst BTC transaction on December
16, 2013, but the volume picks way up on February 4, 2014 when a user, LeancyBTC,
posted an advertisement for the scheme in the Bitcoin forums5. Most reports precede
spikes in investment, though the jump is not always as immediate as in the case of
LeancyBTC’s post.

Fig. 3: Daily volume of payments into and out of Bridge HYIPs, sorted by total pay-
ments received. The green dotted line indicates when the scam is ﬁrst promoted on
bitcointalk.org.

The other key conclusion that can be drawn from these graphs is that the most
successful scams manage to pay out far less than they take in, and they do so consis-
tently over time. In theory, Ponzi schemes need not collapse until withdrawal requests
overwhelm the cash reserves of the scammer. In practice, for Leancy and Cryptory, the
scheme stopped paying out as soon as the funds stopped ﬂowing in. These operators
could have kept up the appearance of legitimacy by honoring withdrawal requests after
new deposits stopped, but they chose not to. Instead, they found it more proﬁtable to
simply disappear once the deposits did.

For the less successful scams (bottom of graph), the outgoing payments often ex-
ceed the incoming payments. Hence, in these cases it does appear that the scammer
gave up once the scam failed to take off, even after honoring withdrawal requests that
exceeding available deposits.

3.3 Bitcoin-only HYIPs

In addition to HYIPs that happen to accept bitcoin, many shady operators have set up
Ponzi schemes using bitcoin as a method of payment. We term these frauds Bitcoin-only
HYIPs because they operate like HYIPs even if they do not share the same heritage as
traditional HYIPs.

The premise behind Bitcoin-only HYIPs varies considerably. Some purport to be
legitimate investment vehicles. The biggest of these is Bitcoin Savings and Trust (ﬁrst
launched under the name “First Pirate Savings and Trust”) which allegedly raised 4.5
million USD [7]. (Unfortunately, since the address used for this Ponzi was also used for
a legitimate Bitcoin marketplace, we do not include it in our analysis.) Others purport
to be online Bitcoin wallets offering an outlandishly high daily rate of return on the
money kept in the wallet. While these schemes are fraudulent by design, they lure in
unsuspecting, na¨ıve victims as well as those fully aware that they are investing in a
Ponzi scheme. The rest were transparently Ponzis. Some of these offer an “hourly” rate
of return and purport to deposit that return back hourly. Others offer an increased payout
upon a subsequent pay in. Some schemes just offer a lump payout after a period of time.
In total, we observed 23 Bitcoin-only Ponzi schemes, which earned 1 562 BTC
(843K USD) from January 2, 2013 through September 9, 2014. Table 2 reports the key
summary statistics. Compared to Bridge HYIPs, Bitcoin-only HYIPs are shorter-lived
and less proﬁtable. The schemes collapse within 37 days (median) and the scammers
have collectively netted only $40K during that time. Again, we expect that some of the
payouts to victims are actually addresses controlled by scammers, so the scammer’s
proﬁt is likely higher.

4 Mining Scams

Since virtually every operation that sells mining equipment has been accused of being
a scam, we adopt the narrower deﬁnition of scams as those mining operations that take
payments from “investors” but never deliver product. Note that “cloud mining” oper-
ations that are transparently Ponzi schemes are considered in our HYIP discussion in
Section 3. Furthermore, we also exclude the many “cloud mining” operations that have
not been shown to be Ponzi schemes but are dubious in nature.

We analyze ﬁve mining scams (Labcoin, Active Mining Corporation, Ice Drill,
AsicMiningEquipment.com, Dragon-Miner.com). We consider Labcoin
here instead of Section 3 since it did not promise outrageous returns and it did purport
to deliver hashing output to some degree6. Similarly, Active Mining and Ice Drill are
operations that raised money to purportedly make ASICs and share the proﬁts but never
delivered. AsicMiningEquipment.com and Dragon-Miner.com are fraudu-
lent mining e-commerce websites.

Relevant summary statistics are presented in Table 3. Notably, due to the nature of

the scam, none of this contributed money is returned to the victims.

5 Scam Wallets

We now consider fraudulent services that masquerade as Bitcoin wallets. Note that we
categorize wallets that purport to offer a daily return on savings as Ponzi schemes and
discuss them in Section 3. Scam wallets, by contrast, offer many of the features of online
wallets, but with a key difference: the operators siphon some or all of the currency
transferred to the wallet.

The basic ruse goes as follows:

1. Victim deposits bitcoin into scam wallet.
2. If the amount of money falls below the threshold, the money stays.
3. If the amount of money is above the threshold, the scammer moves the money into

her own wallet.

We identiﬁed this process by examining 15 threads on the bitcointalk.org
forums and 7 threads on the Bitcoin subreddit (reddit.com/r/bitcoin) where
users complained of losing money once they began depositing larger amounts. Bit-
cointalk users drgonzo7 and Artificial8put over 10 bitcoin into their respec-
tive Easy Coin accounts in early 2013 but were each left with 0.099 bitcoin (0.1
bitcoin minus their mixing fee) immediately following. Whereas Bitcointalk user
BitcoinOnFire 9 reports that the ﬁrst Easy Coin transaction he made worked, but
when he moved over a few bitcoin in early 2014, that was quickly drained. Bitcointalk
user Kazimir10 reports that putting in less than 0.1 bitcoin into Bitcoinwallet.in in
late 2013 which was ﬁne. Reddit user LutherForThePeople11 reports putting in a
small amount of bitcoin into Easy Coin in 2013 which was ﬁne and then upon putting
in more bitcoin, the scammers drained his account.

We were able to analyze three of these services (Onion Wallet12, Easy Coin13, and
Bitcoinwallet.in14 ), in which all transfers from the victims were ultimately delivered
to the same address held by the scammer. These particular scams advertise themselves
as offering a mixing service that enhances transaction anonymity for customers. In fact,
all three services appear to be operated by the same scammer, because the siphoning
transfers all go directly to the same Bitcoin address. The wallets do in fact operate
a mixing service, which makes it impractical to trace back incoming transfers from
victims into the service. However, since the scammer sends all stolen bitcoins to the
same address, we are able to track the ill-gotten gains for these three scams collectively.
Figure 4 (top) plots the amount of Bitcoin drained out of victim accounts each week.
The highly volatile trend suggests that the scam had more success in 2013 compared to

2014. However, normalizing the scammer intake against the BTC–USD exchange rate,
as in Figure 4 (bottom), tells a different story. It suggests that the scammer drains off
an amount of BTC corresponding to a steady USD-denominated wage. Compared to
the Bitcoin HYIPs and mining scams, these wallet scams offer a much steadier stream
of between $10–40K in ill-gotten gains each week. In total, this scammer’s revenue
(through 11 September 2014) was about 4 100 BTC, which corresponds to nearly $1
million. Finally, we note that the scam continues unabated at the time of this writing.

6 Bitcoin Exchange Scams

We look at four scams purporting to be Bitcoin exchanges: BTC Promo, btcQuick,
CoinOpend, and Ubitex. Most of these scams entice victims by offering features that
many other exchanges do not offer such as PayPal/Credit Card processing, or a better
exchange rate than established players. Unfortunately for the customer, they they never
actually receive the bitcoin or cash after making payment. Ubitex purported to be an in-
person exchange, but never got off the ground. Speculation exists as to whether Ubitex
is a scam or just a ﬂopped business, but we treat it as a scam here.

Table 3 reports the key ﬁgures for the scam exchanges. The longer-lived scam
exchanges survived for approximately three months, but they also drew in the least
amount of money from victims. CoinOpend and btcQuick each operated for less than
one month, but during that time drew in hundreds of thousands of dollars from victims.

15 20.189BTC corresponding to $15 515 reported invested on GLBSE, but not trackable on block

chain. Address is from bitcointalk forum post asking for Ubitex donations.

7 Discussion

7.1 Revisiting the Scam Categories
The scams presented differ in several key ways, as summarized in Table 4. First, we can
see that Bridge HYIPs have taken in the most revenue from victims. This may reﬂect
the more mature nature of these scams, as traditional HYIPs have been operating for
years. Thus, they already have an established base of users and extensive advertising.
The Bitcoin-based schemes, by contrast, are much newer and so we would expect that
the scams are not as reﬁned. A less optimistic interpretation, therefore, is that there
is considerable room for growth in the magnitude of these frauds as Bitcoin increases
in popularity. Furthermore, we note that true total of scammer proﬁts could be much
higher, given that we could only track revenues for 21% of the reported scams.

The scams also differ in the way they “hook” victims. HYIPs exploit people’s greed,
or more precisely, their susceptibility to the narrative that it is easy to get rich quick just
by using Bitcoin. Mining scams exploit this same desire, but wrap it in more measured
promises of future riches. Mining scams are classic advanced-fee fraud: victims pay
money in hopes of getting larger sums down the line, but that day never comes.

12

Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore

Fig. 5: Lorenz curve for Bridge HYIPs (left) and Bitcoin-only HYIPs (right).

Wallet and exchange scams, by contrast, exploit the difﬁculty people have in judging
the legitimacy of web services. Thus, the scammers take advantage of an information
asymmetry that naturally exists. So long as it is difﬁcult to distinguish between good
services and bad ones, there will remain an opening for scammers to proﬁt.

User awareness to the scams also varies considerably. Some participants in HYIPs
know that they are likely investing in a Ponzi scheme, but they hope to cash out before
the scheme collapses. Most Bitcoin-based HYIPs, however, are transparent about the
dodgy nature of the service. For example, Bit Twin offers to double your bitcoins within
48 hours. Hence, some scams might even be considered a form of gambling. However,
investors in mining, exchange and wallet scams are usually completely unaware that
anything untoward is going on with the service until they have lost their money.

Finally, we can distinguish between how inherently trackable these scams are. Some
bridge HYIPs can be readily tracked, since they publish a single incoming payment
address online. Others use a service such as blockchain.info which generates a
new incoming address for each visitor. Many require investors to sign up ﬁrst in order to
receive the incoming payment address, which could be changed for different investors.
Most Bitcoin-only HYIPs can be readily tracked, since the service usually posts the
address in order to signal trustworthiness in the service. Any service that attempts to
hide the payment addresses would be viewed with suspicion.

Mining, exchange and wallet scams need not be trackable. The ones we observed
happened to make their addresses publicly available, but there is no reason that this
should always be. Hence, we anticipate these frauds to remain difﬁcult to track via the
block chain moving forward.

7.2 How are Victim Payments into Scams Distributed?
We now examine how the size of payments into scams are distributed. This is an impor-
tant question, because it inﬂuences how successful scammers select targets. A relatively

even distribution of payments into scams would indicate that scammers must recruit lots
of victims who each contribute a small but substantial amount. By contrast, an uneven
distribution suggests that scammers should focus on the small number of marks who
will give away the vast majority of the money contributed to the scheme.

To answer this question, we compute measurements typically used in assessing in-
come inequality. Figure 5 plots Lorenz curves for each of the HYIP scams we identi-
ﬁed. Perfect equality would be indicated by a diagonal line with slope equal to 1, while
curves appearing further down and to the right indicate greater inequality in payments
from address groups. The left graph plots Bridge HYIPs while the right plots Bitcoin-
only Ponzis. We see considerable variation, but with a small number of victims con-
tributing much of the payments in most cases. For instance, in Leancy approximately
20% of the victim population contributed 90% of the payments to scammers. We see
even greater variation in the Bitcoin-only HYIPs.

Next, we consider variations across scam categories. Figure 6 (left) plots the Lorenz
curves for all payments into the 3 scam categories. Payments into mining scams are
the most skewed: nearly all of the total contributions come from less than 10% of the
victims. While still very skewed, Bridge HYIPs rely on contributions from more victims
than do the Bitcoin-only HYIPs: the smallest 80% of address groups account for around
5% of the scammer’s haul for Bitcoin-only HYIPs, compared to 15% for Bridge HYIPs.
Figure 6 (right) examines the relationship between inequality of payments into
scams and the total money drawn into the scams. The graph plots the Gini coefﬁcient
for each scam (where 0 indicates all incoming payments are equal and 1 indicates com-
plete inequality) against the total payments paid into each scam. We can see that the
least successful scams tend to be the most equal, whereas the most successful scams are
more unequal. Hence, for a scam to be successful, it appears that it must catch the few
“big ﬁsh” who will pay the bulk of the money into the scam.

The high concentration in payment size into scams has implications for law enforce-
ment actions against the scammers. Most successful scams have a few big contributors,
who might be more willing to assist with in an investigation. Furthermore, the individ-
ual losses suffered by these victims are more likely to meet the threshold required to get
the attention of high-tech crime units.

7.3 Policy Options

We have already established that different types of Bitcoin scams exist, and that many
are growing in popularity. But there are many issues with Bitcoin, as well as cybercrime
in general. Given that context, why might Bitcoin scams matter? Here are three plausi-
ble reasons: (i) if there are many victims, (ii) if substantial amounts of money is being
lost, or (iii) if the scams undermine trust in the ecosystem.

This paper has established a lower bound on answers to the ﬁrst two reasons. The
number of victims and magnitude of their losses, while considerable, is substantially
smaller than those afﬂicted by failures elsewhere in Bitcoin, such as the Mt. Gox col-
lapse. So on the current ﬁgures alone, we cannot conclude that eradicating these scams
should take priority.

However, there are two counterarguments that suggest a more robust response is
warranted. First, the scams are growing substantially in popularity and proﬁtability.
Rooting out the scams at this early stage may be more feasible, and doing so we could
avoid the substantial indirect costs imposed by exposing many new Bitcoin users to
such a negative experience. The second counterargument is that, for the wallet and
exchanges scams at least, their continued prevalence threatens to undermine trust in the
overall ecosystem. If people cannot determine whether the service they are interacting
with is legitimate due to an information asymmetry, then everyone in the ecosystem,
even legitimate exchanges and wallets, suffers.

8 Related Work

High-yield investment programs were ﬁrst documented in the research literature by
Moore et al [5]. They documented over 1 000 such scams, provided a primer on the
ecosystem’s operation, and established that tracking websites accurately monitor the
scam’s operation. Neisius and Clayton also investigated HYIPs, focusing on the proﬁts
accrued by support organizations in setting up and monitoring HYIP scams [6]. Both
papers focused on traditional HYIPs that have operated with impunity for several years
using centralized virtual currencies such as Liberty Reserve and Perfect Money. In this
paper, we have instead focused on HYIPs that use cryptocurrencies as payment. The
block chain has enabled us to accurately measure, for the ﬁrst time, the amount of
money transferred into HYIPs by victims and out by the scam operators.

Huang et. al consider Bitcoin mining malware and quantify the amount of bitcoin
that Bitcoin mining botnets have minted using the block chain [8]. Our paper does
not consider malware, but our block chain analysis techniques are similar to those of
Huang et. al. (as well as Meiklejohn et. al and Ron and Shamir [9–11]). Vasek et. al.
examine the prevalence of denial-of-service attacks against Bitcoin services [12]. These

attacks are another avenue for criminals to proﬁt as well as another threat to Bitcoin’s
success. M¨oser et al systematically analyze Bitcoin mixing services, which some of
the scams we study purport to be [13]. Christin measures transactions made on the Silk
Road, a large online marketplace that was shut down by the US federal government, and
ﬁnds over 1.2 million dollars in sales monthly, despite (or because of?) the purported
anonymity of the marketplace [14]. While the Silk Road is not a scam (though we do not
doubt that there were scammers abusing the service), it has certainly harmed Bitcoin’s
reputation, much like the scams we study might if they became more prevalent. Moore
and Christin studied how often and why Bitcoin-currency exchanges collapsed [15].
While in this paper we investigated fraudulent exchanges set up to steal customer de-
posits, Moore and Christin focused on legitimate exchanges that shut down. While some
label such failed exchanges as scams, particularly when they are unable to return out-
standing customer deposits, we exclude them from consideration here.

The Bitcoin Foundation surveyed prominent Bitcoin participants about different hy-
potheticals that could affect the Bitcoin ecosystem [16]. While they did not explicitly
ask about Bitcoin scams, they found that mismanaged Bitcoin businesses was a top
threat to Bitcoin’s success. They also found people feared Bitcoin getting a “bad rep-
utation” for being a haven for wicked behavior. This includes a concern over Bitcoin
being used for gambling (e.g., many Bitcoin-only HYIPs). The scams presented in this
paper doubtless could harm Bitcoin’s reputation if they are not eradicated.

9 Concluding Remarks

Scams – operations established with fraudulent intent – pose serious dangers to the Bit-
coin ecosystem. First, there is the direct harm imposed on the victims who pass money
to the scammers, never to see it again. Second, and perhaps more substantially, there
is indirect harm imposed on all users, even those who don’t fall victim to scams. This
harm manifests in damage to the reputation of legitimate operations and the undermined
trust of users who become more reticent to try out new services.

Fortunately, the block chain creates an opportunity in that transactions may often
be tracked, which could make it easier to assess the true risk posed by scams and make
it harder for scammers to hide. To that end, in this paper we have presented the ﬁrst
systematic, empirical analysis of Bitcoin scams. We identiﬁed four categories of scams:
Ponzi schemes, mining scams, scam wallets and fraudulent exchanges. By analyzing
transactions into and out of 42 such scams, we estimate that approximately $11 million
has been contributed to scams by at least 13 000 victims, much of it within the past year.
We found that Bridge HYIPs, an established scam that predates Bitcoin, take in
60% of the total revenue. The block chain has enabled us to more accurately estimate
the ﬁnancial success of these scams than in previous work, by directly measuring money
ﬂowing into HYIPs for the ﬁrst time. We also worry that the other scam categories may
soon rise to the level of HYIPs as scammers wise up to what is possible.

To combat any future rise, continued measurement of the threat as outlined in this
paper is essential. Furthermore, by investigating losses from victims contributing the
largest amounts, there may be an opportunity for law enforcement to crack down on
scams more effectively.
