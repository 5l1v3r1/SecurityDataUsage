Abstract. The Bitcoin scheme is a rare example of a large scale global
payment system in which all the transactions are publicly accessible (but
in an anonymous way). We downloaded the full history of this scheme,
and analyzed many statistical properties of its associated transaction
graph. In this paper we answer for the ﬁrst time a variety of interest-
ing questions about the typical behavior of users, how they acquire and
how they spend their bitcoins, the balance of bitcoins they keep in their
accounts, and how they move bitcoins between their various accounts in
order to better protect their privacy. In addition, we isolated all the large
transactions in the system, and discovered that almost all of them are
closely related to a single large transaction that took place in November
2010, even though the associated users apparently tried to hide this fact
with many strange looking long chains and fork-merge structures in the
transaction graph.

Introduction

Bitcoins are digital coins which are not issued by any government, bank, or
organization, and rely on cryptographic protocols and a distributed network of
users to mint, store, and transfer. The scheme was ﬁrst suggested in 2008 by
Satoshi Nakamoto [1], and became fully operational in January 2009. It had
attracted a large number of users and a lot of media attention [2] [3] [4], but so
far it was diﬃcult to get precise answers to simple questions such as: How many
diﬀerent users are there in the system? How many bitcoins are typically kept in
each account, and how does this balance vary over time? Are most bitcoins kept
by a few large users? Do they keep their bitcoins in “saving accounts” or do they
spend them immediately? How many users had large balances at some point in
time? What is the size distribution of bitcoin transactions, and how many of
them are micropayments?

In this paper we answer some of these questions. We use the fact that all the
transactions ever carried out in the Bitcoin system are available on the inter-
net (in an anonymous way). On May 13th 2012 we downloaded the full public

record of this system 1, which consisted of about 180,000 HTML ﬁles. After
parsing and processing these ﬁles, we built a graph of all the Bitcoin addresses
and transactions up to that date. We then used the methodology described in
the next section in order to try to identify which addresses are likely to belong
to the same entity, and used this information to contract the transaction graph
by merging such addresses, in order to get a more accurate picture of the full
ﬁnancial activity of each user. We then analyzed many statistical properties of
both the original and the contracted transaction graphs (most of our statistical
results were very similar for the two graphs, within a factor of 2). The most
interesting and informative distributions we found are described in a series of
tables. In addition, we isolated all the large (≥ 50, 000 bitcoins) transactions
which were ever recorded in the system, and analyzed how these amounts were
accumulated and then spent. We discovered that almost all these large transac-
tions were the descendants of a single large transaction involving 90,000 bitcoins
which took place on November 8th 2010, and that the subgraph of these transac-
tions contains many strange looking chains and fork-merge structures, in which
a large balance is either transferred within a few hours through hundreds of
temporary intermediate accounts, or split into many small amounts which are
sent to diﬀerent accounts only in order to be recombined shortly afterwards into
essentially the same amount in a new account.

There was one previous reported attempt [5] to download and analyze the
full Bitcoin history, which also used the same methodology to try to contract
all the addresses which are believed to belong to the same user. They created
the graph of transactions on July 12th 2011, which was before the scheme really
caught on. Thus, the total number of Bitcoins participating in all the transactions
in our graph is about three times larger than in their graph. In addition, we
expect the transactions in our more mature graph to better represent typical
use of the system, whereas their graph represents primarily the experiments
run by early adopters. However, the biggest diﬀerence between our papers is
that they were primarily interested in privacy issues, whereas we are primarily
interested in the statistical properties of the bitcoin transaction graph. Another
analysis of the Bitcoin transaction graph was presented at the Chaos Computer
Club Conference in Germany in December 2011 [6]. Again, they were primarily
interested in how to defeat the anonymity of the network, but also included
some interesting comments about the economic principles behind the scheme,
the eﬀect of lost coins on its operation, weaknesses in its protocols, and the
general topological properties of this transaction graph.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the Bitcoin
scheme. In Section 3 we summarize the main statistical distributions we ex-
tracted from the downloaded transactions, which describe many interesting and

blockexplorer.com/ should be exactly the same as what one could get as a Bitcoin
client. Even if there are tiny diﬀerences they are likely to have only a negligible eﬀect
on our statistical results.

even surprising properties of the scheme. Finally, in Section 4 we present the
graph of the largest transactions and analyze its strange structure.

2 The Bitcoin Scheme

Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic cash system using peer-to-peer networking
to enable payments between parties without relying on mutual trust. It was ﬁrst
described in a paper by Satoshi Nakamoto (widely presumed to be a pseudonym)
in 2008. Payments are made in bitcoins (BTC’s), which are digital coins issued
and transferred by the Bitcoin network. The data of all these transactions, after
being validated with a proof-of-work system, is collected into what is called the
block chain.

Participants begin using bitcoin by ﬁrst acquiring a program called a Bitcoin
wallet and one or more Bitcoin addresses. Bitcoin addresses are used for receiving
bitcoins, in the same way that e-mail addresses are used for receiving e-mails.
Even though Bitcoin is considered to be an experimental payment system, it
is already deployed on a large scale (in the sense that the current value of all
the coins issued so far exceeds 100,000,000 USD) and attracts a lot of media
attention. Its proponents claim that it is the ﬁrst truly global currency which
does not discriminate its users based on citizenship or location, it is always
running with no holidays, it is easy to secure with very low usage fees, it has
no chargebacks, etc. On the other hand, its detractors claim that it is widely
misused to buy illegal items [7] and to launder large sums of money, and that it
is too easy to steal bitcoins from wallets via cyber attacks.

Unlike ﬁat currency, which has been declared to be legal tender by a gov-
ernment despite the fact that it has no intrinsic value and is not backed by
reserves, the Bitcoin scheme has no centralized issuing authority. The network
is programmed to increase the money supply in a slowly increasing geometric
series until the total number of bitcoins reaches an upper limit of about 21 mil-
lion BTC’s. Bitcoins are awarded to Bitcoin “miners” for solving increasingly
diﬃcult proof-of-work problems which conﬁrm transactions and prevent double-
spending. The network currently requires over one million times more work for
conﬁrming a block and receiving an award (currently 50 BTC’s) than when the
ﬁrst blocks were conﬁrmed.

The exchange rate of bitcoins has ﬂuctuated widely over the years, from
merely $0.01 to over $30 per BTC. Today (October 2012) it is worth a little over
$12 per BTC. The entire activity in the Bitcoin network is publicly available
through the internet in two major forms, and the one we decided to download
appears as a block chain, starting at block 0 [8] (created back on the 3rd of
January 2009). Each block reports on as little as a single transaction to as much
as over a thousand transactions, and provides hyperlinks to other blocks and to
other activities of each address.

Many users adopt the Bitcoin payment system for political and philosophi-
cal reasons. Each user can have an unbounded number of addresses (which are
characterized by their public/private key pairs) owned by him. A transaction

4

in bitcoins is a generalization of a regular bank transaction in the sense that it
allows multiple sending addresses and multiple receiving addresses in the same
transaction. It speciﬁes how many bitcoins were taken from each sending address
and how many bitcoins were credited to each receiving address, without the de-
tails of who gave how much to whom. An address may receive bitcoins which
are either newly minted or have a speciﬁc sending address. Another important
diﬀerence between bitcoin transactions and regular bank transactions is the no-
tion of change, which is related to the fact that bitcoins are kept in (possibly
fractional sized) chunks which have to be transferred in an all or nothing way.
For example, a user can have three chunks of 10 bitcoins each. A transaction can
spend 12.5 bitcoins by transferring the ﬁrst full chunk plus 2.5 bitcoins from the
second chunk, and then the 7.5 bitcoin change should be sent to a new address
owned by the same user with new public and private keys. The user then has the
option of either transferring the third chunk to the new address, or leaving it in
the old address. In fact, it is considered good practice for a user to generate a
new address, i.e., public-private key-pair, for every transaction even if this is not
necessary. To better protect their identity, users are advised to take the follow-
ing steps: they do not have to reveal any identifying information in connection
with their addresses; they can repeatedly send varying fractions of their BTC’s
to themselves using multiple (newly generated) addresses; and/or they can use
a trusted third-party in the form of a shared e-wallet to mix their transactions
with those of other owners.

These operational and privacy policies of the Bitcoin scheme make it de-
sirable for us to try to contract the transaction graph in order to get a more
informative picture of the total assets and ﬁnancial activities of users which are
associated with many addresses, and to try to distinguish between “internal”
and “external” transfers of bitcoins in it. Performing this contraction in a com-
pletely accurate way seems to be extremely diﬃcult, but we can use the available
data in order to try to ﬁnd a good ﬁrst approximation. Since many transactions
have multiple sending addresses, we can make the reasonable assumption that
all these addresses have the same owner. We then compute the transitive closure
of this property over all the transactions. For example, if there is one transaction
in which 1 and 2 are used as sending addresses, and another transaction in which
2 and 3 are used as sending addresses, we conclude that all three addresses are
jointly owned. This can lead to two types of errors: We can underestimate the
common ownership of some addresses because there was no evidence for it in the
available data, and we can overestimate it if several users decided to pool their
activities and to send a single transaction to which each one of them contributes
some of the sending addresses. Discussions with several members of the Bitcoin
community lead us to believe that at the moment there are likely to be very
few overestimation errors of this type, but quite a few underestimation errors.
For example, when we tried to use all the available transactions to merge the
addresses of a particular large user, we were told that we managed to identify
with our methodology only about one quarter of his real addresses. Note that the
linkability of the addresses does not imply that the identity of the user becomes

Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph

known. However, if we have any external information about the real ownership
of any one of the merged addresses, we can get a fuller picture of the Bitcoin
activity of that particular individual or organization. For example, since Wik-
iLeaks publicly advertised one of its addresses when it asked for donations, we
can estimate with our methodology that WikiLeaks owns at least 83 addresses,
that it was involved in at least 1088 transactions, and that it had an accumulated
income in all these addresses of 2605.25 BTC’s.

We acquired the complete state of the Bitcoin transaction system on May 13th
2012, which contained all the transactions carried out in the system since its in-
ception on January 3rd 2009 until that date. This required downloading 180,001
separate but linked HTML ﬁles, starting from block number 180, 000 [9] and fol-
lowing the links backwards to the zeroth block initiating the system in January
2009. Each ﬁle was parsed in order to extract all the multisender/multireceiver
transactions in it, and then the collection of transactions was encoded as a stan-
dard database on our local machine. We then ran a variant of a Union-Find graph
algorithm [10] in order to ﬁnd sets of addresses which are expected to belong to
the same user. We merged all the nodes and combined all the transactions which
can be associated with him (without eliminating the internal transfers, which
become self loops in the new graph). We call the original transaction graph the
address graph, and the contracted transaction graph the entity graph (we avoid
using the word “owner” with its complex legal connotations since we do not
really know who owns each address, and instead use the neutral word “entity”
as our best approximation to the common owner of multiple addresses). All the
statistics described in Section 3 are derived from both the address graph and the
entity graph, as indicated in the tables. In most (but not all) cases, we expect
the statistics to change monotonically as we move from the address graph to
the entity graph and then to the (unknown) owner graph, since each entity is
typically the union of several addresses which we managed to merge, and each
real owner is typically the union of several entities that we failed to merge. For
example, since the average balance of an address is 2.4 BTC’s and the average
balance of an entity is 3.7, we can argue that the average balance of an owner
is likely to be larger than 3.7 BTC’s. This monotonicity can thus be used to
provide plausible upper or lower bounds for the statistical properties of the real
ownership graph, even though we do not know it.

3 Statistics Calculated Over the Bitcoin Transaction

Graph

At the time we downloaded the graph there were 3,730,218 diﬀerent public keys,
each associated with a diﬀerent address: 3,120,948 of them were involved as
senders in at least one transaction, while the additional 609,270 appear in the
network only as receivers of BTC’s. By running the Union-Find algorithm, we
were able to associate the 3,120,948 addresses with 1,851,544 diﬀerent entities.
Since the other 609,270 addresses were never used as senders, they could not be
merged with any other addresses by the Union-Find algorithm, and thus they

6

all remained as entities with a single address. By adding these singletons, we get
a total of 2,460,814 entities, which implies that each one of them has on average
about 1.5 addresses. However, there is a huge variance in this statistics, and
in fact one entity is associated with 156,722 diﬀerent addresses. By analyzing
some of these addresses and following their transactions, it is easy to determine
that this entity is Mt.Gox, which is the most popular Bitcoin Exchange site
(responsible for almost 80% of all the exchange operations in the network). The
full distribution of the number of addresses per entity is given in Table 1.

In our reduced entity graph, each m-to-n transaction has a single sender
(since the m sending addresses necessarily belong to the same entity) and at
most n receivers. It can thus be decomposed into at most n diﬀerent transactions
from the single entity associated with the m senders to the entities associated
with the n receivers. In case some of the receiving addresses are identiﬁed as
belonging to the same entity, their amounts are accumulated to create a single
common transaction, and if some of the receivers are identiﬁed with the single
sender, we create a single self loop with the combined amounts. The resulting
entity graph has 7,134,836 single sender and single receiver transactions, out of
which 814,044 (about 11%) involve Deepbit (the largest Bitcoin mining pool),
and 477,526 (about 7%) involve Mt.Gox. About 10% of the transactions are self
loops. The entity graph is not connected as it is composed of 133,742 diﬀerent
connected components, many of size one. For instance, there are as many as
43,710 components (about 33%) consisting of a single address which are used
only for accepting (one or several batches of) freshly minted bitcoins, and which
have never participated in any incoming or outgoing transactions. Note that the
address graph has a larger number of 13,734,847 transactions of lower values,
since a single transaction with 2 sending addresses and 3 receiving addresses is
represented in the address graph as 6 single-sender and single-receiver transac-
tions.

There are many types of statistics and graphs about the Bitcoin network
which can be readily downloaded from the internet [11] [12]. However, these types
of statistics tend to describe some global property of the network over time, such
as the number of daily transactions, their total volume, the number of bitcoins
minted so far, and the exchange rate between bitcoins and US dollars. We can
go much further than that, since the entire transaction graph can be used to
determine the ﬁnancial history of each entity including all of its sending/receiving
activities along with the daily balance of bitcoins in its various addresses and
how they vary over time. Having this entity graph at hand enables us to study
various statistical properties of the network, which are not easy to determine by
following a small number of online links in the Blockexplorer representation of
the Bitcoin network. In the rest of this section, we describe some of our ﬁndings
so far.

Here is our ﬁrst surprising discovery, which is related to the question of
whether most bitcoins are stored or spent. The total number of BTC’s in the
system is linear in the number of blocks. Each block is associated with the gen-
eration of 50 new BTC’s and thus there are 9,000,050 BTC’s in our address

graph (generated from the 180,001 blocks between block number zero and block
number 180,000). If we sum up the amounts accumulated at the 609,270 ad-
dresses which only receive and never send any BTC’s, we see that they contain
7,019,100 BTC’s, which are almost 78% of all existing BTC’s. Due to the way
bitcoins can be repeatedly moved to fresh addresses, some of which can be very
recent, we can not claim that all these bitcoins are out of circulation. However,
76.5% of these 78% (i.e., 59.7% of all the coins in the system) are “old coins”,
deﬁned as bitcoins received at some address more than three months before the
cut oﬀ date (May 13th 2012), which were not followed by any outgoing transac-
tions from that address after they were received. One can also argue that very
old dormant bitcoins were simply abandoned or lost by users who experimented
with the system in its early days, when it was very diﬃcult to buy anything or
to exchange bitcoins into dollars. To be even more cautious with our estima-
tion of dormant bitcoins, we decided to ignore all the transactions which took
place prior to July 18th 2010, when Mt.Gox started its exchange and price quot-
ing services. The sum of the balances of all the addresses which have not been
active since that date is 1,657,480 bitcoins. Clearly, by considering all these bit-
coins as “lost” rather than “hoarded” we are underestimating the number of
bitcoins which are kept dormant in “saving accounts”. By ignoring these very
old bitcoins and repeating the same calculation, we found that 73% of all the
remaining BTC’s were accumulated at addresses which only receive and never
send bitcoins, and that 70% of these 73% (i.e., 51%) are dormant bitcoins in the
sense that they were received more than three months before our cutoﬀ date but
after it became easy to exchange them. If instead of summing the transaction
values we sum the ﬁnal balances of all the addresses that were active after July
18th 2010 but became inactive in the last three months, we get that 55% of all
coins in the system are dormant in this sense. This is strong evidence that the
majority of bitcoins are not circulating in the system, and since it is based on the
address rather than the entity graph, this conclusion is not aﬀected by possible
inaccuracies in the way we associate addresses with users. Note that the total
number of bitcoins participating in all the transactions since the establishment
of the system (except for the actual minting operations) is 423,287,950 BTC’s,
and thus each coin which is in circulation had to be moved a large number of
times to account for this total ﬂow.

A previously proposed measure of the level of activity in Bitcoin was the idea
of “bitcoin days destroyed” [13], which gives more weight to coins which haven’t
been spent in a while. To do this, one multiplies the amount of each transaction
by the number of days since those coins were last spent. This is believed to
give a better indication of how much real economic activity is occurring on the
Bitcoin network, rather than just looking at the total transaction volume per
day. The measure we use is incomparable to and fundamentally diﬀerent from
the “bitcoin days destroyed” as it accumulates bitcoins left untouched (for at
least three months) in addresses, without adding any contribution from those
which have been recently moved: What we focus on are those coins that are kept
completely out of circulation.

Another interesting ﬁnding is that the total number of bitcoins received by
most entities and addresses is negligible. In the rest of this section, we use un-
parenthesized numbers to indicate values derived from the entity graph, and
parenthesized numbers to indicate values derived from the address graph. For
example, as can be seen from Table 2, 36% of all entities (and 40% of all ad-
dresses) received fewer than one BTC, currently worth about 12 USD, through-
out their lifetime, 52% (59%) received fewer than 10 BTC’s and 88% (91%) fewer
than 100. At the other end of the distribution there are only four entities (and
one address) which received over 800,000 BTC’s, and 80 entities (129 addresses)
which received over 400,000.

Similarly, as can be seen in Table 3 the current (on May 13th 2012) balance
of almost 97% (98%) of all entities (addresses) was less than 10 BTC’s. This
number decreases to 88% (91%) if instead of looking at one speciﬁc moment,
we look at the maximal balance ever seen throughout an entity’s (address’es)
lifetime. This statistics is summarized in Table 4. In addition, it can be seen
that there are only 78 entities (70 addresses) with current balance larger than
10,000 BTC’s. This number grows to 3,812 (3,876) when looking at the maximal
balance ever seen.

Another measure that may indicate the level of activity of an entity (address)
is the number of transactions it has been involved with. Its distribution is pre-
sented in Table 5. It is remarkable that 97% (93%) of all entities (addresses) had
fewer than 10 transactions each, while 75 entities (80 addresses) use the network
very often and are aﬃliated with at least 5,000 transactions.

We have also calculated the distribution of the size of the transactions in the
two graphs as summarized in Table 6. Again, it is evident that many transactions
are very small, and 28% (47%) are smaller than 0.1 BTC each. The Bitcoin
scheme actually enables sending micro transactions, which are of the order of
10−8 BTC (this is the smallest fraction into which a BTC can be broken, and
is called a satoshi). When we also consider midsize amounts, we see that 73%
(84%) of the transactions involve fewer than 10 BTC’s. On the other hand, large
transactions are rare at Bitcoin: there are only 364 (340) transactions larger
than 50,000 BTC’s. We have carefully inspected all these large transactions and
describe our ﬁndings in the next section.

It is interesting to investigate the most active entities in the Bitcoin system,
those who have either maximal incoming BTC’s or maximal number of trans-
actions. 19 such entities are shown in Table 7 sorted in descending order of the
number of accumulated incoming BTC’s shown in the third column. The left-
most column associates the entities with letters between A to S out of which
three are identiﬁed: B is Mt.Gox, G is Instawallet and L is Deepbit. Eight ad-
ditional entities: F, H, J, M, N, O, P, and Q are pointed out in the graph of
the largest transactions (Fig. 1) which is presented in the next section. The sec-
ond column gives the number of addresses merged into each entity. The fourth
column presents the number of transactions the entity is involved with.

Table 7 shows that Mt.Gox has the maximal number of addresses, but not
the largest accumulated incoming BTC’s nor the largest number of transactions.

Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph

Entity A in the ﬁrst row of Table 7 owns the next largest number of addresses,
about 50% of those of Mt.Gox’s, but received 31% more BTC’s than Mt.Gox.
Deepbit had sent 70% more transactions than Mt.Gox. It is interesting to re-
alize that the number of addresses of 13 of these entities is a ﬁfth or more of
the number of transactions they have executed, which may indicate that each
address is indeed used for just a few transactions. It is also clear that six out
of the 19 entities in the table have each sent fewer than 30 transactions with a
total volume of more than 400,000 BTC’s. Since these entities were using large
transactions, we were able to isolate them and to follow the ﬂow of their trans-
actions, see Section 4 below. On the other hand, entity A had never sent any
large transactions and thus it has not been included in our graph of the largest
transactions.

4 The Graph of the Largest Transactions in Bitcoin
We have identiﬁed and analyzed all the largest (≥ 50, 000 BTC’s) transactions
in the entity graph, (there were 364 such transactions as described in the last
column of Table 6), and followed their ﬂow. We started with the earliest such
large transaction, the one of 90,000 BTC’s made on November 8th 2010. By
tracing each of the other 363 large transactions in this category, we were able
to show that 348 were actual successors of this initial transaction. The resulting
directed graph is depicted in Fig. 1. This graph reveals several characteristic
behaviors of the ﬂow in the Bitcoin transaction graph: long consecutive chains
of transactions, fork-merge patterns that may include self loops, setting aside
BTC’s and ﬁnal distribution of large sums via a binary tree-like structure.

Long Chains. A common prominent practice of Bitcoin users is to create
chains of consecutive transactions. Some of these chains can be explained by the
change mechanism in which small payments are accompanied by the creation
of a new address, into which the user transfers the diﬀerence. Such chains can
be found in Fig. 2, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 7, with lengths of 3, 15, 26, 80, 88
and 350 transactions. However, the behavior seen in Fig. 3 deviates signiﬁcantly
from this pattern, since the same amount of 5,000 bitcoins is repeatedly split
oﬀ the main sum and put into accounts which have no additional transactions
associated with them.

Fork-Merge Patterns and Self Loops. Another frequent scenario in Bit-
coin is transferring a large number of BTC’s from one address to another via
several intermediate addresses, each receiving part of the entire amount and then
sending it, mostly in full, to the same destination whether directly or via other
mediators. Examples can be seen in Fig. 6, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. A harder to follow
fork-merge pattern is presented in Fig. 5: An entity is sending 90,000 BTC’s
to itself three times in self loops. Each time it splits it into diﬀerent amounts,
76+14, 72+18 and 69+21. It uses the same address for the small amounts and
diﬀerent addresses for the large amounts. Then it exchanges the entire 90,000
BTC’s at Mt.Gox. Finally, the 90,000 BTC’s are being transferred via a chain
of 90 transactions using 90 diﬀerent addresses (which may or may not belong to

10

the same owner), where at each one of them 1,000 BTC’s are sent back to the
ﬁrst entity, recombined into essentially the very ﬁrst amount of 90,000 BTC’s.
Keeping Bitcoins in “Saving Accounts”. Another long chain of trans-
actions from the beginning of March 2011 can be seen in Fig. 3. This chain is
diﬀerent from the above ones, since at 28 out of its 30 steps, it puts aside 5,000
BTC’s in what seems to be “saving accounts”. The accumulated sum of 140,000
BTC’s has never been sent since. These bitcoins are an example of our discovery
that most of the bitcoins are not circulating in the system.

Binary Tree-Like Distributions. Often amounts of BTC’s are distributed
among many addresses by splitting it into two similar amounts at each step. This
results in a binary tree-like structure as depicted in Fig. 10 and in Fig. 4.

The Bitcoin system is the best known and most widely used alternative payment
scheme, but so far it was very diﬃcult to get accurate information about how

it is used in practice. In this paper we describe a large number of statistical
properties of the Bitcoin transaction graph, which contains all the transactions
which were carried out by all the users until May 13th 2012. We discovered
that most of the minted bitcoins remain dormant in addresses which had never
participated in any outgoing transactions. We found out that there is a huge
number of tiny transactions which move only a small fraction of a single bit-
coin, but there are also hundreds of transactions which move more than 50,000
bitcoins. We analyzed all these large transactions by following in detail the way
these sums were accumulated and the way they were dispersed, and realized
that almost all these large transactions were descendants of a single transaction
which was carried out in November 2010. Finally, we noted that the subgraph
which contains these large transactions along with their neighborhood has many
strange looking structures which could be an attempt to conceal the existence
and relationship between these transactions, but such an attempt can be foiled
by following the money trail in a suﬃciently persistent way.
