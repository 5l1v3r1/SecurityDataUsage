ABSTRACT
Mobile devices are becoming increasingly dominant in the
developing world. However, there is little insight into the
characteristics of devices being used in such regions. Us-
ing a dataset of ∼0.5 million subscribers from one of the
largest cellular operators in Pakistan, we analyze the char-
acteristics of cell phones based on different features (e.g.,
CPU, memory, and cellular interface). We identify potential
device-level bottlenecks for Internet access and analyze the
security implications of the phones being used. To aid the
analysis of cell phones, we propose abstractions (e.g., con-
nectivity, capacity, and device security) and cluster phones
based on these abstractions. Our analysis reveals interesting
insights for improving mobile web performance.

Mobile devices are becoming increasingly common in devel-
oping regions. The International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) reported that mobile-broadband subscriptions reached
2.3 billion by the end of 2014, with 55% of them in devel-
oping countries [19]. Mobile devices are being used for a
variety of services in such countries including agricultural
information dissemination, education, and health care deliv-
ery [23, 33].

Introduction

While the Internet infrastructure has been steadily improv-
ing in developing regions and several efforts (e.g., Google’s
Project Loon [15] and Facebook’s Connectivity Lab [3]) fo-
cus on providing Internet connectivity via satellites, balloons,
drones, and planes, anecdotal evidence suggests that the com-
mon use of low end devices with a slow Internet connection

can lead to poor user experience in developing regions [6].
Recent studies have explored the issue of poor application
performance from a variety of angles, ranging from core in-
frastructural issues to geographical locations [31, 37]. For
example, recent studies found that the lack of good caching
infrastructure and DNS servers are the primary causes of
poor performance [21, 37]. Another related study has shown
CDN server placements and routing protocols as primary
performance issues [32].

However, there is very little information available about
the characteristics of devices being used in developing coun-
tries and how they may impact Internet access. This paper
presents an in-depth study of cell phones from one of the
largest cellular providers in Pakistan. Using a dataset of
∼0.5 million subscribers, we, (a) present a taxonomy of cell
phones based on different features (e.g., CPU, memory, OS
type, and WiFi support), (b) discuss the implications of cell
phone characteristics (e.g., maximum data rates, user expe-
rience due to browser support, and security vulnerabilities)
for Internet access and identify potential performance bot-
tlenecks, and (c) propose abstractions for classifying phones
along different axes (e.g., connectivity, capacity, and ﬂexi-
bility).

Unlike prior works (e.g., [27]) that study the adoption and
usage of smart phones, our unique focus on the individual
features of cell phones reveals new insights, showing how
mobile devices might be a major bottleneck to Internet ac-
cess. This in turn can inform various stakeholders (e.g., con-
tent providers and Internet service providers) in improving
mobile web performance. We believe this study provides a
missing piece of the puzzle to understand Internet access in
developing regions.

We make the following observations:

• We ﬁnd that 66% of the cell phones support only GSM
(52%) and GPRS (14%), thus they can expect to achieve
no more than 40 kbps of data rates1. On the other hand,
only 11.2% of the cell phones had HSDPA (a.k.a. 3G/3G+)
or LTE capable handsets.

• We ﬁnd that ∼30% cell phones have CPU speeds of less
than 500 MHz. The distribution of memory sizes was found

319to be heavy tailed with most phones (57%) having less
than 10 MB of memory and a small fraction (0.48%) hav-
ing more than 1 GB of RAM. Such phones can often lead
to poor performance for web browsing and web-based mul-
timedia applications [31, 34].

• Our study shows that 58.1% of the phones being used have
actually been discontinued by the vendors. As such, these
phones may be vulnerable to well-known security attacks.
Although, most phones use vendor-speciﬁc operating sys-
tems, Android and Symbian were the most popular mo-
bile operating systems. Android 2.3, 4.0, and 4.1 were the
most widely used versions, all with well-known security
vulnerabilities [4, 14].

• We ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant fraction of phones (49.5%) in our
dataset support only wireless application protocol (WAP)
browsers. Unlike modern web browsers (e.g., Safari or
Chrome), a WAP browser only supports a stripped down
version of XHTML and uses the WAP protocol for access-
ing the Internet. However, it does not support JavaScript.

These ﬁndings suggest that device-level bottlenecks may
be common in developing regions and should be taken into
consideration when designing services for users in such re-
gions. These insights can inform content providers, service
providers, and even vendors on improving access to services.
For example, we ﬁnd that although CPU speeds are high in
several phones, they are equipped with very small memory
sizes. Such phones can beneﬁt by having specialised web
proxies that preprocess websites performing memory inten-
sive computations.

Our work highlights the fact that simply changing the cel-
lular network technology is insufﬁcient, changes in the net-
work must be aware of device limitations. To this end, our
work reinforces the importance of developing regions re-
search that deals with building low cost data communication
channels (e.g., using SMS or voice as the transport mecha-
nism) [25], building specialized proxies for developing coun-
tries [35], and designing applications suited for low-end fea-
ture phones [16, 28, 30]. In particular, using data channels
over SMS/voice can enable or augment existing low data rate
services (e.g., GSM and GPRS) to further improve the actual
data rates. Moreover, non-data channels (e.g., voice) can
also be directly used for building social networking, educa-
tion, and health care applications. For example, Polly [30],
a viral telephone-based system aims to reach low-literate
population for development related services through a voice-
based game.

In summary, this paper makes the following key contribu-

tions:
• We present a data-driven study of the characteristics of
mobile devices in a developing country. Towards this end,
we build a custom cell phone database containing 19 cell
phone features (§2).

• We analyze the security implications of the cell phones
being used, identify potential device-level bottlenecks and

discuss how they may impact Internet access in a develop-
ing area like Pakistan (§3).

• We develop a tool to characterize website support for WAP
browsers. Using this tool, we survey the top 300 websites
in Pakistan and found that while 25% of websites pro-
vide a signiﬁcantly smaller version of their site for WAP
browsers, only 6% are truly WAP compliant (i.e., no JavaScript
or rich content) (§4).

• To aid the analysis of cell phones, we propose abstractions
(e.g., connectivity, capacity, ﬂexibility, and device secu-
rity) and cluster phones based on these abstractions. Our
analysis reveals interesting insights for improving mobile
web performance (§5).

2 Dataset
Our dataset comprises twelve months (Jan 2014 – Dec 2014)
of anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) for district Jhelum
from one of the largest cellular operators in Pakistan. The
Jhelum district has an area of approximately 3,500 km2, and
a 2013 population estimate of ∼1.2 million. The dataset con-
tains information about ∼0.5 million unique subscribers and
the mobile devices they used. As 3G and 4G services were
launched in Pakistan in April, 2014, we present analysis only
for the month of December, 2014 to capture the latest set of
cell phones being used.

We use the available device information (i.e., cell phone
name and model) to construct a cell phone database by fetch-
ing information from online sources [8, 10]. Our dataset
contains 19 cell phone features including information about
the cellular interface supported (e.g., GPRS, EDGE, HSPDA,
and LTE), WiFi interface (e.g., 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n),
CPU speed, amount of memory, operating system (OS), phone
status (i.e., continued/discontinued), camera, and GPS, email,
and browser support. Figure 1a shows the fraction of cell
phones as a function of different features whose information
was available to us2. For example, our database had infor-
mation about the browser used in 77.3% of the cell phones.
Our dataset contains ∼4000 unique cell phone models.
Figure 1b shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the number of phones having a phone model. Observe
that ∼80% of the phone models have less than 200 phones
2Due to space limitations, Figure 1a shows information for
only a subset of the features.

whereas only ∼5% of the phone models have at least 5000
phones each.
3 Taxonomy
In this section, we present a taxonomy of cell phones in
our dataset based on a variety of features including cellu-
lar/WiFi interfaces, CPU speed and RAM capacity, OS type
and phone status, and browser support.
3.1 Cellular/WiFi Interfaces
Cellular Interface: We now present a classiﬁcation of phones
based on the cellular technology they support. We ﬁnd that
52% of the phones support only GSM as shown in Figure 2.
GPRS and EDGE are fairly common and together make up
36.8% of the phones. HSPDA and LTE make up 11.2% of
all the phones in our dataset.

Table 1 shows the typical downlink data rates supported
by these technologies. Given that most phones only sup-
port GSM, their achievable data rate is upper bounded by
9.6 kbps [12], which is too low for supporting most popular
data services and applications. ∼66% of the phones (i.e.,
GSM and GPRS combined) can expect to achieve no more
than 40 kbps of data rates (which is a typical data rate offered
by GPRS [13]). Together with EDGE, 88.4% of the phones
can expect no more than 236 kbps of data rates3.

lular technologies.

Cellular technologies across cell phones models: We also
study the distribution of cellular technologies over the dif-
ferent cell phone models (∼4000) present in our dataset. We
found that only 13.6% of the phone models in our dataset
had GSM support as shown in Figure 2b but they made up
52% of the phones in our dataset. ∼29% of the phone mod-
els supported HSDPA (a.k.a. 3G+) but these represented only
10.6% of the phones in our dataset. A possible reason for
this trend is the high cost of such cell phones.

3This is the typical EDGE data rate offered in Pakistan [17].

Figure 3: Distribution of WiFi standards across cell
phones in our dataset.

WiFi Interface: In our dataset, only 12.5% of the phones
had WiFi interfaces whereas 30.9% of the phones models
had WiFi support. Figure 3 shows how different WiFi stan-
dards are distributed across phones that were equipped with
WiFi interfaces. Interestingly, 53.6% of the phones had 802.11n
capability and 39.7% had phones that only supported 802.11g.
This in contrast to countries like the US, where 97.7% of de-
vices were reported to be 802.11n capable during the same
time period [22].

It is interesting to observe that despite the popularity of
802.11n, which supports a maximum data rate of 600 Mbps,
a signiﬁcant fraction of cell phone models (∼46.1%) are still
limited to the low data rate 802.11b and 802.11g standards,
which provide a data rate of up to 11 Mbps and 54 Mbps,
respectively.
3.2 CPU/RAM
Cell phones with slow CPUs and small memory sizes often
lead to poor application performance (e.g., for web browsing
and web-based multimedia [28, 34]). Therefore, we now
present a classiﬁcation of phones based on their CPU speeds
and memory sizes.
Processor: Table 2 shows the CPU speeds of cell phones in
our database. We found that ∼32% of the phones had CPU
speeds of less than 500 MHz. While cell phones with CPU
speeds between 500 MHz and 1 GHz were most popular, cell
phones with greater than 1 GHz speeds and multiple cores
were much less popular. We found that 87% of the phone
models with slow CPUs (i.e., less than 500 MHz) supported
Email and 48% of such phones supported running third party
applications, suggesting slow performance for CPU inten-
sive tasks.

sizes of cell phones. We ﬁnd that 57% of the cell phones
had less than 10 MB of RAM whereas only 0.485% of the
phones had more than 1 GB of memory. The minimum and

maximum memory sizes we observed were 1 MB and 3 GB,
respectively. We found that 95% of the phones with small
memory (i.e., ≤ 5 MB) supported Email and 84% of such
phones supported running third party applications.
3.3 OS Type/Phone Status
We now discuss the distribution of mobile operating sys-
tems across phones. We found that 84.8% of the phones had
vendor-speciﬁc operating systems whose information was
not available. Figure 4a shows the distribution of cell phone
OSes across the remaining 15.2% phones (∼76k phones).
Observe that 30.8% of the cell phones used Android fol-
lowed by Symbian (31.4%).

We found that the three most popular versions of Android
were 2.3, 4.0, and 4.1 as shown in Figure 4b. The observed
mobile operating systems have well-known security vulner-
abilities as shown in Table 4 [4, 14]. As such, these devices
can be readily exploited to launch various attacks such as
DoS attacks, attacks on privacy, and memory corruption.
Phone Status: Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that 58.1% of the phones
have been discontinued or cancelled by the vendors. These
phones may be vulnerable to known security attacks as there
is no continuous vendor support for addressing them. Such
phones are likely to remain available in developing coun-
tries for quite sometime as they are low cost and reselling of
phones is fairly common in such regions.

3.4 WAP Support
A WAP browser is designed for mobile devices and uses the
WAP for Internet access. WAP 2.0 uses a cut down ver-
sion of XHTML with end-to-end HTTP. Mobile devices pro-
cess XHTML Mobile Proﬁle (XHTMLMP), the markup lan-
guage deﬁned in WAP 2.0.

We found that 49.5% of the phones supported WAP whereas

89.8% of the phone models had WAP. Figure 5 shows the
distribution of WAP versions found in our dataset. Observe
that most phones supported WAP 2.0 (76.4%) whereas only
5.5% supported WAP 1.1. We expand on this in the next sec-
tion and explore support for WAP from popular websites in
Pakistan.

Figure 5: Distribution of phones which support WAP.

4 Characterizing Support for WAP Browser
In the last section, we observed that a signiﬁcant fraction of
phones (49.5%) in our dataset supported only WAP browsers
and not modern browsers (e.g., Safari or Chrome). Recall
that unlike modern rich browsers, WAP browsers support a
stripped down version of XHTML. More importantly, WAP
browsers do not support JavaScript and do not feature rich
multimedia content (e.g., Flash and videos). Naturally, an
interesting question is this:

“Given that WAP is a dominant browser, what fraction of

websites support WAP browsers?”

To answer this question, we develop a web crawler that
visits the top 300 websites in Pakistan according to the Alexa
list [2]. The web crawler sets its “user-agent" to match those
of the most popular devices in our dataset: Nokia3360.

We compared the website delivered when the crawler used

a WAP user-agent against the website delivered when a Chrome
user-agent was used. We observed that 25% of the sites ex-
plored delivered a lighter version (with fewer images and
scripts) of their website to the web-crawler when it used a
WAP speciﬁc user-agent. Even more surprisingly, we found
that only 6% of the sites delivered truly WAP friendly ver-

Un-
surprisingly, the 6% included large online service providers
(e.g., Facebook, Google, Live, and Amazon) and several lo-
cal sites, e.g., ummat.net (one of Pakistan’s popular Urdu
newspapers).
5 Characterizing Cell Phones
To aid analysis, we now propose four abstractions for cell
phone features that represent groups of similar features4:
connectivity, capacity, ﬂexibility, and insecurity. These ab-
stractions allow us to analyze the (a) network bandwidth of-
fered by cell phones, (b) their computational resources, (c)
ﬂexibility in supporting third party applications and running
modern browsers, and (d) vulnerability of a device to known
attacks5. Moreover, by reducing the feature set, these ab-
stractions allow low-dimensional visualizations.

We then cluster cell phones based on these abstractions,
which allows us to perform (a) cross-category analysis and
answer questions such as: do cell phones with high speed
network interfaces have enough computational resources to
utilize the network bandwidth? do more ﬂexible cell phones
(e.g., that provide support for running third party applica-
tions) tend to be more insecure? and (b) allows prediction of
an abstraction (or features) given the knowledge of other ab-
stractions and similar cell phones. This can be useful when
complete information about a particular cell phone is not
available6 (e.g., if the cell phone was discontinued several
years back but is still being used). For instance, a network
service provider may use the network interface of the phone
to infer whether the device maybe using an outdated phone,
and then use a middlebox to enhance the device security.
5.1 Abstractions for Features
1. Connectivity (V): To characterize the network interface
speed offered by a cell phone, we use the average of the
maximum data rates7 offered by the cellular and WiFi in-
terfaces present in a cell phone as follows:

where Rcell and Rwif i are the maximum data rates sup-
ported by the cellular technology and the WiFi interface
in a cell phone, respectively. Rmax
wif i are the
maximum data rates across all cellular technologies and
WiFi standards found in our dataset, respectively and used
for normalization. Observe that a value of V close to zero
4Other abstractions are indeed possible, however, we choose
these abstractions based on the domain knowledge about the
features we have seen.
5They allow us to reason about a collection of related fea-
tures (e.g., network connectivity as opposed to speciﬁc in-
terfaces such as WiFi, 3G, or Bluetooth).
6We could not ﬁnd information about the CPU speeds of
∼70% of the phone models in our dataset even though infor-
mation about their cellular interface was available.
7Using the maximum data rate informs us about the max-
imum access capacity, which a multi-path transport like
MPTCP can utilize under ideal network conditions.

indicates poor connectivity whereas a value close to 1 in-
dicates that the phone can support very high data rates for
both interfaces.

2. Capacity (C): We characterize the capacity of a cell phone
based on its CPU speed and memory size. These features
indicate how fast a phone can perform computations as
well as the kind of applications it can run. Like with con-
nectivity, we deﬁne capacity as the unweighted average of
the CPU speed and memory size, which are normalized
by their maximum values in the dataset.

3. Flexibility (F): This refers to the ability of a cell phone to
run applications like Email, Internet browser, and provide
support for running third party applications. We deﬁne
ﬂexibility, F , as the average of three features:

F = (Btype + E + A)/3

(2)
where features Btype, E, and A and their values are de-
ﬁned in Table 5.

4. Insecurity (S): We deﬁne the insecurity of a device as the
average of its status (equal to 1 if the device has been dis-
continued8 and 0 otherwise) and the ratio of the known
vulnerabilities of the device to the total vulnerabilities
across all devices in our dataset.

5.2 Clustering
Using the above abstractions for cell phone features, we now
cluster phones and carry out a cross-abstraction analysis.
Figure 6 shows the visualization of one such clustering us-
ing parallel coordinates. Here, we simply cluster the phones
based on their connectivity value, using k-means clustering
[26] and a cluster size of four9. Each parallel vertical axis
corresponds to an abstraction and each connected line seg-
ments represent a cell phone. We ﬁnd that for a given level
of connectivity, there exists a large range of phone capaci-
ties, which indicates that high speed network interfaces are
8It indicates that the device software would no longer be up-
dated by the vendor and any security vulnerabilities would
remain unchecked until the use of the device is discontinued.
9We choose the cluster size using the Elbow method [24],
which gave a sum of squared error of less than 0.02 for
a cluster size of four with only marginal improvement for
larger cluster sizes.

323These insights suggest that (a) pre-processing webpages on a
proxy server can speed up client-side page load process [35],
(b) computations that require high CPU processing and/or
memory can be ofﬂoaded to the cloud [36], (c) for phones
with weak security, providers can provision middleboxes to
enhance the device security, and (d) service providers can
auto-tune TCP/HTTP parameters based on phone features.
Implications for developing regions research: Our insights
reinforce the importance of research on building low cost
data communication channels and developing applications
suited for low-end phones [20, 25, 29, 30]. For example,
Hermes [25] modulates data onto acoustic signals that are
sent over a cellular voice call. It provides 1.2 kbps of good-
put at a cost per byte that is 50× lower than sending data
over SMS, which achieves ∼0.25 kbps of data rate. For
cell phones with basic GSM support, such communication
channels can provide data service and increase data rates.
Similarly, building health, education, and social network-
ing applications for low end phones can beneﬁt a large frac-
tion of users in the developing world. For example, SMSall
[16] (previously Chopal) is a mobile social network based
on SMS that is reportedly being used by more than 7 mil-
lion users. Polly [30], a viral telephone-based system aims
to reach low-literate population for development-related ser-
vices through a voice-based game.
Implications for security: Given that a large number of phones
(∼58.1%) have been discontinued but are still being used,
these phones are vulnerable to a wide range of security at-
tacks. Moreover, as feature information is not available for
all cell phones, an attacker can use similar analysis of ab-
stractions to correlate similar phones to infer missing fea-
ture information. For example, consider two cell phones A
and B. Suppose the cellular interface type of both A and B
is known. While phone A has been discontinued by the ven-
dor, B’s status information is unavailable. An attacker can
use the cellular interface type of the phones to infer that B
may be outdated. Similarly, by inferring the OS type, an at-
tacker can search through online databases (e.g., [4, 14]) for
well-known exploits to launch guided and systematic attacks
(e.g., privilege escalation, memory corruption, DoS attacks,
and SQL injection).
7 Conclusion
We presented an in-depth study of cell phones from one of
the largest cellular providers in Pakistan. Towards this end,
we built a custom cell phone database containing 19 cell
phone features. We analyzed the security implications of
the cell phones being used, identiﬁed potential device-level
bottlenecks, and discussed how they may impact Internet ac-
cess in a developing country like Pakistan. To simplify anal-
ysis of cell phone features, we proposed abstractions and
clustered phones based on these abstractions. Our analysis
provides new insights that can inform various stakeholders
(e.g., service providers and content providers) in the Internet
ecosystem for improving mobile web performance.

not necessarily commensurate with high CPU speeds and/or
large memory sizes. We also observe that connectivity value
can be a good indicator for predicting ﬂexibility and insecu-
rity but not phone capacity. This observation could be used
by ISPs and service providers to infer the security and ﬂex-
ibility characteristics of a device based on its network inter-
face type.
6 Discussion and Implications
How is the distribution of phones likely to change over time?
We computed the change in the top-10 phone models (which
make up ∼25% of the phones in our dataset) and the top-
1000 phone models (making up ∼95% of the phones) across
3 months (i.e., October, November, and December). We
found that the change in the top-10 and top-1000 phone mod-
els in the last 3 months was 0% and 0.1%, respectively. This
suggests that the rate of change in cell phone models is low.
Comparison with other public sources of data and countries:
The analysis of our dataset shows that it correlates well with
other sources of public data. For example, a report [1] found
Android to be the most popular OS for smartphone users
in Pakistan. Our dataset showed Android and Symbian to be
the most popular OSes among smartphone users. In a remote
community in Indonesia, Hartigan et al. [27] found that only
∼16% of the phones were smartphones. While we do not
speciﬁcally identify smartphones, 12.5% of the users in our
dataset had phones with WiFi interfaces, which suggests a
similar fraction of smartphones.
Infrastructure support for low-end cell phones: Our anal-
ysis reveals insights that can guide infrastructure support
needed to improve web experience of users with low end cell
phones. One key insight from our work is that changes in the
network must be aware of device limitations. For example,
a substantial fraction of cell phones are equipped with low
data rate cellular interfaces (e.g., GSM, GPRS, and EDGE)
and have slow CPUs and small memory sizes. Many such
phones provide support for running third party applications.
