ABSTRACT
We use historical BGP data and recent active measurements
to analyze trends in the growth, structure, dynamics and
performance of the evolving IPv6 Internet, and compare
them to the evolution of IPv4. We ﬁnd that the IPv6 net-
work is maturing, albeit slowly. While most core Internet
transit providers have deployed IPv6, edge networks are lag-
ging. Early IPv6 network deployment was stronger in Eu-
rope and the Asia-Paciﬁc region, than in North America.
Current IPv6 network deployment still shows the same pat-
tern. The IPv6 topology is characterized by a single domi-
nant player – Hurricane Electric – which appears in a large
fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is more dominant in IPv6
than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics
in the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4,
and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the
underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that per-
formance over IPv6 paths is comparable to that over IPv4
paths if the AS-level paths are the same, but can be much
worse than IPv4 if the AS-level paths diﬀer.

INTRODUCTION

The Internet operations, engineering and research commu-
nities are putting signiﬁcant attention into a relatively new
version (actually 15 years old) of the Internet Protocol – IP
version 6 (IPv6) [1] – designed to solve several architectural
limitations of the existing IPv4 protocol. The most essen-
tial characteristic of IPv6 is that it has provides orders of
magnitude more address space than the world’s foreseeable
IP connectivity needs.
IPv6 has become especially perti-
nent in the last two years because the global Internet ad-
dress allocation architecture relies on the presence of a free
pool of IP addresses to allocate to sites operating Internet
infrastructure. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) exhausted its unallocated address pool in February
2011, and the Asia-Paciﬁc region (represented by the AP-
NIC RIR) followed suit in April 2011. The remaining RIRs
too are expected to run out of unallocated addresses in the
next few years [2]. This exogenous pressure from IPv4 ad-
dress scarcity has driven widespread adoption of IPv6 into
modern operating systems and network equipment. Major
network operators and content providers are deploying IPv6
on both a trial and production basis [3], and some govern-
ments are mandating IPv6 support [4, 5]. But there is little
hard data about how mature the IPv6 network is in terms
of composition, topology, routing, and performance.

While IPv6 penetration remains small compared to IPv4,
the IPv6 network topology has shown two distinct growth
phases – for both ASes and AS links, an initial linear growth
(y=ax+b) followed by exponential (y=aebx) gives the best
ﬁt with the data, with the change in trajectory occurring
around 2008. The exponents for ASes and AS links are
0.13 and 0.16, respectively (Figure 1). It is interesting that
the IPv4 network topology growth shifted from exponential
to linear a decade ago [6]. While the current exponential
growth of IPv6 hints that it may ﬁnally have shifted from
an experimental or “toy” network to production, the nature
of its growth is still largely undocumented. Which network
types and geographic regions contribute the most? Does the
growing IPv6 network appear to converge toward the exist-
ing IPv4 network? How do routing dynamics in IPv6 com-
pare to IPv4? Does performance over IPv6 paths approach
that over IPv4 paths?

In this study we use historical BGP archives and recent
active measurements of the public IPv4 and IPv6 network
infrastructures to analyze the state of maturity of IPv6 de-

ployment along three dimensions: topology, routing, and
performance. Section 2 describes the data sources and sup-
porting analysis techniques we use throughout the paper.
We ﬁnd that the IPv6 network is maturing, as indicated by
its increasing similarity in size and composition (Section 3),
AS path congruity (Section 4), topological structure (Sec-
tion 5), and dynamics (Section 6), to the public IPv4 In-
ternet. While core Internet transit providers have mostly
deployed IPv6, edge networks are lagging behind. While all
geographic regions show exponential growth in IPv6 adop-
tion, early IPv6 deployment was stronger in Europe and
the Asia-Paciﬁc region than in North America. The IPv6
network is characterized by the presence of a single promi-
nent player, Hurricane Electric (HE). Hurricane Electric cur-
rently appears in between 20% and 95% of IPv6 AS paths
seen from diﬀerent vantage points, and is more prominent
in IPv6 than the most prominent player in IPv4. Further,
when IPv4 and IPv6 AS paths diﬀer, HE is the network
most often added to the IPv6 path. Routing dynamics in
the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4. While
routing churn grows linearly in IPv4 and super-linearly in
IPv6, it is important to note that these trends match those
of the underlying IPv4 and IPv6 AS topology growth.
In
terms of performance (Section 7), our measurements show
that IPv6 data-plane performance closely matches IPv4 per-
formance when the AS-level paths are the same, while it can
be signiﬁcantly worse when AS-level paths diﬀer.

2. DATASETS AND METHODS

We use a variety of data sources and analysis methods,
which we summarize here, providing more detail in sections
that use speciﬁc data. Our analysis of the IPv6 Internet’s
size, routing behavior, and structure (Sections 3-5) relies on
publicly available historical BGP tables. Section 6 uses BGP
updates from the same public repositories to analyze rout-
ing dynamics of the IPv4 and IPv6 networks over time. We
gather our own data using active measurements from ﬁve
vantage points around the world, to compare and correlate
IPv4 and IPv6 performance with other growth parameters.
To compare the composition of the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs ac-
cording to type of networks, we classify the business types of
ASes using the algorithm presented in our previous work [6]

and the business relationships of the links between them
(e.g., customer, provider, peer) using Gao’s algorithm [7].

BGP topology data
We collected historical BGP data from the two major public
repositories at RouteViews [8] and RIPE [9]. We rely only
on these two data sources because no other source of topo-
logical/routing data (routing registries, traceroutes, looking
glass servers, etc.) provides historical information. Route-
views and RIPE started collecting IPv4 BGP data as early
as 1998; the ﬁrst IPv6 collector, however, became active in
2003. Consequently, our IPv4 data spans 14 years from 1998
to 2011, while the IPv6 data is from 2003 to 2011. The use of
Routeviews/RIPE repositories of BGP data has been shown
to inadequately expose the complete Internet topology [10,
11, 12] – although this data captures most ASes, it misses a
signiﬁcant fraction of peering and backup links at the edges
of the Internet [13, 12, 14]. However, we are mainly inter-
ested in customer-provider links used most of the time. AS
links revealed by short term failures and transient routing
events can “confuse” an evolutionary study, misinterpreting
link disappearances and appearances due to transient fail-
ures as link deaths and births respectively. For example, the
primary link lp between ASes X and Y fails at time t1, caus-
ing the activation of a backup link lb between ASes X and Z.
lp is repaired at t2 and the connectivity returns to its original
state. Since we focus on primary links, our goal is to ignore
the transient event during (t1, t2) and not detect lb. On
the other hand, a change of routing policy that makes lb the
primary link should be detected as the death of lp and the
birth of lb. To remove backup and transient links, we apply
the method of “majority ﬁltering” described in our previous
work [6] on the set of BGP AS paths obtained from BGP
table dumps at Routeviews and RIPE collectors. We do not
use BGP updates to construct our topology snapshots, as
these reveal backup and transient links which we want to
ﬁlter. The majority ﬁltering method works as follows. For
both IPv4 and IPv6, we construct a topology snapshot by
collecting 5 sets of AS paths over a duration of 3 weeks,
only using AS paths that were seen in a majority of those
ﬁve samples. We collect such a topology snapshot every 3
months, resulting in 56 snapshots of the IPv4 topology and
36 snapshots of the IPv6 topology. We refer the reader to
our previous work [6] for a detailed description of the data
collection and pre-processing.

BGP routing dynamics data
Our comparative analysis of routing dynamics of the IPv4
and IPv6 infrastructures is based on BGP updates collected
by the Routeviews project. Routeviews collectors run BGP
sessions with routers (or monitors) in many networks. Each
monitor sends a BGP update to the collector every time
there is a change in the preferred path from the monitor to
a destination preﬁx. We use update traces from two Route-
views collectors: Routeviews6 for IPv6 data and Oregon-
IX for IPv4 data. The IPv4 updates span the period from
1 Jan 2003 to 16 Feb 2012, while the IPv6 updates span
7 May 2003 through 16 Feb 2012. We use monitors from
ﬁve networks that contributed both IPv4 and IPv6 routing
data throughout the study period: AT&T, Hurricane Elec-
tric (HE), NTT-America, and Tinet, and IIJ. AT&T’s IPv4
monitor was unavailable for three months in 2003, and its
IPv6 monitor was unavailable between May 2005 and May

5382007. Tinet’s IPv6 monitor was unavailable between June
2008 and June 2010. If the multi-hop BGP session between a
monitor and the collector is broken and re-established (ses-
sion reset), the monitor re-announces all its known paths,
producing large bursts of updates. This is a local artifact
of the Routeviews measurement infrastructure, and does not
represent genuine routing dynamics. We use the method de-
veloped by Zhang et al. [15] to identify and remove updates
caused by session resets.

AS relationships
We use Gao’s AS relationship classiﬁcation algorithm [7] to
infer the business relationship associated with each inter-AS
link.1 For each snapshot, we apply this algorithm to the set
of IPv4 AS paths. Gao’s algorithm classiﬁes AS links into
the following types: sibling, customer-provider, settlement-
free peer, and unknown. Our focus is on customer-provider
and settlement-free peering links, so we exclude the sibling
and unknown classes, which account for fewer than 1% of
the AS links in any snapshot.

AS classiﬁcation
In our previous work [6], we developed a method to clas-
sify ASes according to their expected business type. The
method relies on a machine learning decision tree classiﬁer
which uses as input two properties inferred for each AS – the
average number of customers and average number of peers
over the lifespan of that AS. By peers we mean settlement-
free peers in a routing sense; we cannot know for sure if
there is a settlement between them. In that study we used
this method to classify each AS into four classes – Enterprise
Customer (EC), Small Transit Provider (STP), Large Tran-
sit Provider (LTP), and Content/Access/Hosting Provider
(CAHP) – with an accuracy of 85%. Note that the AS types
we consider are quite distinct from each other in terms of
their function and business goals. It is thus reasonable to
expect that ASes do not change from one AS type to an-
other during their lifetime. We validated this assumption
in our previous work by running the classiﬁcation algorithm
using only a two-year dataset; we found that only 3% of AS
classiﬁcations changed as compared to the entire dataset [6].
For this study we repeated the classiﬁcation algorithm using
the 14-year dataset described above to obtain a new classi-
ﬁcation. Of the ASes present in both datasets, only 2.4%
had a diﬀerent classiﬁcation. We assume that an AS has the
same business type in IPv6 as in IPv4. We further classify
ASes according to their primary geographical region of oper-
ation, as reﬂected in the RIR database (WHOIS) where the
AS is registered: ARIN (North America), RIPE (Europe,
Middle East, and the former USSR), APNIC (Asia/Paciﬁc),
AfriNIC (Africa), and LACNIC (Latin America).

Performance data
Similar to the method employed by Nikkhah et al. [16], we
measure the average time to fetch a page from webservers
registered in the DNS with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that
have the same origin AS number in the longest matching
BGP route. We use the Alexa list of the one-million most
popular websites in the Internet, testing up to three web-
servers for each origin AS. We try to avoid a common prob-

AS relationship classiﬁcation algorithm, but for this study
we use Gao [7].

lem with throughput measurements, namely never getting
out of TCP’s slow start phase, by seeking to download a
page that is at least 10,000 bytes. If the web site’s root page
is smaller than that, we fetch the smallest object embedded
in that page that is at least 10,000 bytes2. While a thresh-
old of 10,000 bytes is not always suﬃcient to get out of slow
start, it seeks to balance the tradeoﬀ between ﬁnding a large
number of web objects to download, and ensuring that those
objects are suﬃciently large. We fetch each page three times
from each webserver, alternating IPv4 and IPv6 transport
sequentially. Each measurement begins approximately ﬁve
seconds after the previous one completes to avoid competing
measurements but also to minimize the chance of network
topology changes mid-measurement. We also measure the
forward AS-level IPv4 and IPv6 paths using traceroute with
TCP probes immediately after the sequence of performance
measurements completes. We collected this data from ﬁve
vantage points: a state network in New York; a research
network in Japan; a commercial ISP in Japan; a commercial
network in the Netherlands; and an enterprise customer in
the Netherlands. We sanitized our measurements as in [16]:
We excluded from performance evaluation those measure-
ments where the standard error of the mean download time
(for either IPv4 or IPv6) was greater than 10% (at the 95%
signiﬁcance level), or the object sizes in IPv4 and IPv6 were
not within 1% of each other. This ﬁltering left us with 544
dual-stack ASes represented in our dataset, consisting of 233
ECs, 106 STPs, 10 LTPs, and 195 CAHPs according to the
previously described classiﬁcation. We used scamper’s tbit
and traceroute implementations [17]; the former includes a
test that fetches a page, negotiating TCP SACK and TCP
timestamps, and records all packets sent and received dur-
ing the test, which allows us to further examine the packet
traces to infer why performance may diﬀer.

3. GROWTH TRENDS BY BUSINESS TYPE

AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION

While overall growth rates indicate that IPv6 deployment
is accelerating, these growth rates diﬀer by (business) type
of network and geographic region. Since IPv6 provides es-
sentially the same functionality as IPv4, we hypothesize that
as IPv6 matures, the distribution of business types in IPv6
should resemble that in IPv4. Geographic coverage of IPv6
may not exhibit the same convergence with IPv4 given the
pre-existing allocation of IPv4 address space around the
world and various levels of pressure by diﬀerent national
governments to promote IPv6.

3.1 Growth trends by business type

Figure 2 shows the fraction of networks over time from
each of the four business types mentioned in Section 2, for
the IPv4 (top panel) and IPv6 (bottom panel) topologies.
Above each panel, we show the total number of ASes in
the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs over which the fractions are com-
puted. At least since 1998 (when historical BGP data be-
came available), the IPv4 topology has always consisted of
a large fraction of EC networks; currently 90% of ASes are
EC, while STPs and CAHPs comprise most of the remaining
10%. In 2003 only 35% of IPv6 networks were of type EC,
but this fraction has increased steadily, currently at 60%.
The relatively large fractions of STPs and CAHPs in the

Figure 2: As IPv6 matures the fraction of EC ASes
has grown from 35% to over 60% of the IPv6 graph,
while IPv4 has seen little change, with ECs currently
at 90%.

IPv6 topology suggests that IPv6 deployment has primarily
occurred at the core of the network, driven by transit and
content providers.

To further explore the evolution of business types in IPv6,
we measure growth trends for each AS type in the IPv4 and
IPv6 graphs. We ﬁnd that ECs, STPs and CAHPs all grow
linearly in IPv4 after 2001. The IPv6 graph has evolved dif-
ferently. For ECs, STPs, and CAHPs, we ﬁnd that an initial
linear growth phase from 2003 (when data archiving began)
until 2007-2008, followed by exponential growth until the
present time gives the best ﬁt with the data. The exponents
for ECs, STPs, and CAHPs in the exponential growth phase
are 0.16, 0.09, and 0.08, respectively.3

We also measure the growth rate (in ASes/month) of each
business type in the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs (graph omitted
due to space constraints). In both the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs,
ECs show the highest growth rate, although the growth rate
of ECs in the IPv4 graph (between 50 and 350 ASes/month
over the last 14 years) has always been larger than in the
IPv6 graph. Only since 2011 has the EC growth rate in
IPv6 been comparable to that in the IPv4 graph. In fact,
the growth rate of ECs in the IPv6 graph reached a peak of
182 ASes/month in mid-2011 and then declined, coincident
with World IPv6 Day [18] in June 2011, and consistent with
Aben’s observation that the overall growth rate of IPv6 ASes
peaked around the World IPv6 day [19]. The growth rate of
STP and CAHP ASes in IPv4 has been almost constant over
the last 14 years (between -2 and 20 ASes/month); interest-
ingly, the growth rates for these types in the IPv6 graph are
similar (between -2 and 40 ASes/month), and since 2010,
the growth rates in IPv6 are larger than those in IPv4 (in
fact, STPs and CAHPs show recent negative growth in the
IPv4 graph). The recent spurt in the growth rate of IPv6
ECs to a level that is comparable with the growth rate of
IPv4 ECs is encouraging: it implies that IPv6 deployment at
the edges, which has historically lagged behind deployment
at the core, is now catching up.

RIPE overtook ARIN in the IPv4 graph in 2009;
RIPE has always been ahead in IPv6.

3.2 Growth trends by geographical region

Figure 3 shows the number of ASes in diﬀerent geograph-
ical regions over time, according to the RIR WHOIS map-
pings described in Section 2. We omit the two smallest reg-
istries (LACNIC and AfriNIC), which have so few ASes com-
pared to the three large registries (ARIN, RIPE and APNIC)
that they are barely visible in the graph. The graph shows
that for IPv4, the growth rate of RIPE-registered ASes has
exceeded that of ARIN-registered ASes for the last decade
(though both ARIN and RIPE showed linear growth in this
period), and as of 2009 the RIPE region has more ASes
than the ARIN region, a big diﬀerence from the early days
of IPv4. For the IPv6 graph, on the other hand, the growth
trend for each of the ARIN, RIPE and APNIC registries
shows two distinct periods since 2003 – an initial linear phase
followed by an exponential phase (with exponents 0.13, 0.13
and 0.11, respectively) until the present time. For ARIN
and RIPE, the change from linear to exponential happened
around 2007-2008, while for APNIC it was at the start of
2009. Unlike IPv4, however, the RIPE region has always
had more ASes in IPv6 than ARIN. APNIC had more ASes
than ARIN until 2008, when the IPv6 AS growth rate in
the ARIN region changed to exponential. While the RIPE
and APNIC regions led early adoption of IPv6, adoption in
the ARIN region is accelerating, and the number of ARIN-
registered and RIPE-registered ASes in IPv6 currently grow
at the same rates.

The business type classiﬁcation of the previous section re-
veals more insight into growth across diﬀerent geographic
regions. Although growth in ECs in diﬀerent regions mostly
follows the same trends as for all ASes (shown in Figure 3),
STPs and CAHPs behave diﬀerently. In the IPv4 graph, the
growth rate of ARIN-registered STPs was almost identical
to that of RIPE-registered STPs (around 5 ASes/month)
until 2002. Since 2002, however, the growth rate of ARIN-
registered STPs has slowed to 1.5 ASes/month, while that
of RIPE-registered STPs is around 3 ASes/month. Con-
sequently, the number of RIPE-registered STPs soon sur-
passed ARIN-registered STPs. This diﬀerence may derive
from contrasting regulatory environments which led to more
competition in the transit market in Europe than in North
America. Another possible explanation is the tendency of
small Eastern European networks to use Provider-Indepen-
dent (PI) address space [20] which is typically advertised in
BGP with its own ASN, rather than Provider-Aggregatable

a provider network. In the IPv6 graph the number of STPs
and CAHPs in the RIPE region has exceeded that of the
ARIN region since 2003 (the start of IPv6 data collection),
consistent with the stronger community pressure in Europe
for operators to support IPv6, including European Commis-
sion funding for IPv6 deployment from its early stages.

4. EVOLVING STRUCTURE OF IPV4 AND

IPV6 TOPOLOGIES: AS PATHS

Similar to our belief that the composition of a maturing
IPv6 topology should look more like the IPv4 topology, we
also expect a convergence to occur between the best AS
path between a given pair of ASes in IPv4 and IPv6. An-
other reason to compare IPv4 and IPv6 AS path congruity
is its correlation with performance.
In Section 7 we show
that IPv6 data plane performance is worse than IPv4 when
the AS paths diﬀer, but when the AS paths are the same,
IPv6 performance is comparable to that of IPv4. Improved
congruity between IPv4 and IPv6 paths seem to improve
IPv6 performance, which is likely to further promote IPv6
deployment. To explore trends in congruity between IPv4
and IPv6 paths, we ﬁrst calculate the fraction of AS paths
from a given vantage point (VP) toward dual-stacked origin
ASes (i.e., ASes that advertise both IPv4 and IPv6 preﬁxes)
that are identical in IPv4 and IPv6. If there are multiple
IPv4 or IPv6 AS paths available between a given VP and
an origin AS, we report it having an identical AS path if
any of the paths are the same. If they diﬀer, we dissect the

diﬀerences, in terms of which ASes are added and removed
from those paths. This analysis also reveals the presence of
dominant players in the IPv6 topology.

We ﬁrst measure the evolution of IPv6 from seven van-
tage points listed in Table 1 (four LTPs, two STPs, and
one CAHP) which have provided BGP data to Routeviews
and RIS since 2003. For each topology snapshot, we use the
set of majority-ﬁltered (as described in Section 2) AS paths
exported by these six monitors. We remove all prepending
from AS paths, and discard paths with AS sets or loops.
This ﬁltering process rejects 0.1% of AS paths due to AS
sets or loops.

Identical AS paths in IPv4 and IPv6
Figure 4 plots the fraction of dual-stack paths that are iden-
tical in IPv4 and IPv6 from each vantage point over time.
According to this metric, IPv6 paths are maturing slowly.
In January 2004, 10-20% of paths were the same for IPv4
and IPv6; eight years later, 40-50% of paths are the same for
six of the seven vantage points. The most signiﬁcant trend
in this data is the rise in prominence of Hurricane Electric.
In April 2007 only 5% of its dual-stacked paths were identi-
cal, but in 2012 just over 50% of dual-stacked paths are the
same from Hurricane’s perspective.

Diﬀerent ASes in IPv4 and IPv6 AS paths
Since only between 40% and 50% of the AS paths from diﬀer-
ent vantage points to dual-stacked origin ASes are the same,
the next question is: how do the paths diﬀer? We compute
the AS edits required to make the IPv4 paths identical to the

Figure 6: Average AS path lengths to dual-stacked origin networks over time from diﬀerent vantage points,
and the fraction of paths of length 2 (directly connected), length ≤ 3, and so on. In January 2011, HE was
directly connected to 40% of dual-stacked origin ASes in IPv6. Since 2003, other transit providers have
observed the fraction of directly connected dual-stack ASes decrease.

IPv6 paths – speciﬁcally, which ASes are most often added
and removed from AS paths that diﬀer. Between 2011 and
2012 Hurricane Electric was added to between 20% and 50%
of IPv6 paths that were diﬀerent to a corresponding IPv4
path, depending on the vantage point. There were no other
ASes added to IPv6 paths as frequently and consistently
across vantage points as Hurricane. No AS is consistently
missing from IPv4 paths.

ASes most frequently seen in AS paths
Next, we examine the AS paths from all BGP vantage points
(VPs) that provide a full table4 to Routeviews and RIPE
collectors in October 2011 to determine the relative promi-
nence of ASes in the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies. We deﬁne
the prominence of an AS X to a VP as the fraction of origin
ASes that are reached through it.5 While the AS that ap-
pears most often depends on the VP in question, we ﬁnd that
for all IPv6 VPs, Hurricane Electric appears in the largest
fraction of AS paths (between 20% and 95%, see Figure 5).
Contrast this with the importance of Hurricane Electric in
the IPv4 topology, where it appears in fewer than 10% of
AS paths from any given vantage point. Level3 (AS3356),
the largest player in the IPv4 space in terms of this metric,
appears in between 5% and 80% of IPv4 AS paths, depend-
ing on the vantage point. This data suggests that Hurricane
Electric is more prominent in the IPv6 graph than the most
prominent player in the IPv4 graph.

AS path lengths in IPv4 and IPv6
Even though the IPv4 AS graph continues to grow in the
number of ASes (linearly, after initial exponential growth
until 2002), the average AS path length as measured from
Routeviews/RIPE vantage points is almost constant around
4 AS hops since January 1998 [6]. We emphasize that this
result is based on ASes that provide data to Routeviews and
RIPE collectors, and does not necessarily reﬂect the aver-
age AS path length that an arbitrary AS sees. Figure 7

4We deﬁne a VP as having a full table if it has BGP paths
to at least 35,000 IPv4 ASes and 3,900 IPv6 ASes.
5This metric is related to betweenness centrality, but only
uses paths observed from a single VP.

shows the average path length (in AS hops after removing
AS prepending) in the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies over time,
as measured from all Routeviews and RIPE vantage points.
The average AS path length for IPv6 shows a decreasing
trend, and showed a sharp decrease since 2008. This re-
sult is counter-intuitive, given the relative sparseness of the
IPv6 topology as compared to the IPv4 topology. We dig
deeper into the possible reasons for the decreasing IPv6 AS
path length, by measuring the average AS path length from
diﬀerent IPv6 capable monitors over time.

Figure 6 shows the average AS path length seen from the
perspective of Hurricane Electric (6(a)), and from the other
vantage points (6(b)). The average path lengths from van-
tage points other than HE are similar, hence we group them
together. The plot also shows the number of AS paths of
length 2 (origin AS is directly connected to the VP), of
length ≤ 3, and so on. Our main observation is that the
average IPv6 AS path length seen by Hurricane Electric de-
creases, while for other transit providers it is almost con-
stant. The fraction of ASes directly connected to Hurricane
in IPv6 increased from 10% in Jan 2007 to 40% in Jan 2010,
perhaps as a result of Hurricane’s open peering policy in
IPv6 [21]. Other transit providers saw the fraction of dual-
stacked networks that are directly connected decline (indi-
cated by the curve labeled “==2” in Figure 6(b)), further
conﬁrming the rising dominance of HE in the IPv6 topol-
ogy. We conclude that the overall decreasing trend seen in
the average IPv6 AS path length is due to this increasing
dominance of HE in the IPv6 topology. We recommend cau-
tion in analyzing graph properties of the IPv6 AS topology;
due to its relatively small size, the presence of even a few
important ASes such as Hurricane Electric can signiﬁcantly
aﬀect overall graph properties.

5. EVOLVING STRUCTURE OF IPV4 AND

IPV6 TOPOLOGIES: AS GRAPHS

We next directly compare the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies
over time. Again we hypothesize that as the IPv6 network
matures, its topological structure should grow more congru-
ent with IPv4’s structure, i.e., an increasing fraction of ASes
and AS links will be common to both topologies, the most

542highly connected ASes should grow to be more similar in
both topologies, and upstream IPv4 and IPv6 providers for
the same edge AS should eventually converge.

5.1 Common ASes and AS links in the IPv4

and IPv6 graphs

For each topology snapshot, we ﬁnd the set of ASes that
are present in either the IPv4 or the IPv6 AS topology, which
we call the combined topology. In each snapshot, more than
99% of ASes and more than 96% of AS links in the combined
topology were present in the IPv4 topology, i.e., the number
of ASes that are unique to the IPv6 topology is negligibly
small. Consequently, we focus most of our analysis on the
set of ASes from the combined topology that were present
in the IPv6 topology.

Common ASes present in IPv6 topology
Figure 8 shows the fraction of ASes from the combined topol-
ogy that are present in the IPv6 topology. We measure these
fractions for all ASes, and further classify ASes according to
business type. We ﬁnd that the fraction of ASes from the
combined topology that are seen in the IPv6 topology varies
widely depending on business type. Almost all LTPs are
now seen in the IPv6 topology; The 3 exceptions are AS1
(owned by Level 3 Communications, but no longer the pri-
mary ASN), AS7132 (owned by AT&T. AS7018, also owned
by AT&T is in the IPv6 topology), and AS3786 (owned by
LG DACOM. AS9316 owned by the same organization is in
the IPv6 topology). Signiﬁcantly, around 50% of STPs and
CAHPs from the combined topology are also present in IPv6,
while fewer than 10% of ECs are seen in the IPv6 topology.
Since the combined AS topology is dominated by ECs, the
overall fraction of ASes seen in IPv6 is similarly low, which
further conﬁrms our earlier observation that IPv6 adoption
is faster in the core of the network while the edge (ECs) has
been slow to deploy IPv6.

We also measured the fraction of ASes from the combined
topology that are present in IPv6, separately for each geo-
graphic region (ﬁgure omitted due to space constraints). We
ﬁnd that this fraction is less than 20% for each geographic
region. As of late 2011, the APNIC region (for which 16%
of ASes from the combined topology are present in IPv6) is
slightly ahead of RIPE (14%), which is well ahead of ARIN
(9%). Interestingly, this ordering is the same order in which
the registries either ran out (APNIC in April 2011 [2]) or
are projected to run out of IPv4 addresses (RIPE in Au-
gust 2012, and ARIN in June 2013). As early as 2003, news

reports claimed APNIC to run out of allocatable IPv4 ad-
dresses ﬁrst, with RIPE and ARIN soon to follow [22].

ASes unique to the IPv6 topology
We brieﬂy comment on the small set of ASes that were
present only in the IPv6 topology.
In our latest topology
snapshot from October 2011, 109 ASes were only in the IPv6
topology. Of these, 42 ASes (34 ECs, 5 STP, and 3 CAHPs)
were in the IPv4 topology in some previous snapshot (and
hence we were able to assign business types to these ASes).
Inspection of the as-names and descriptions of the other 67
ASes (as they appear in the RIR whois databases) reveals
that 27 can be trivially matched with ASes in the IPv4 topol-
ogy that have similar names and descriptions. This over-
lap hints at organizations using separate ASes to provide
IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity. Furthermore, we found that 2
ASes unique to the IPv6 topology were administered by uni-
versities that used IPv4 address space announced from the
respective national research and education networks ASes.
This shows that organizational boundaries of the entities
that manage ASes in the IPv4 and IPv6 topology do not
always align.

Common top ASes
We measure the fraction of the top-K ASes (in terms of AS
degree) from the IPv4 topology that are also top among the
top-K ASes in the IPv6 topology. As the IPv6 network ma-
tures, we expect that the top ASes from the IPv4 topology
will also appear as the top ASes in the IPv6 topology. Fig-
ure 9 shows the fraction of the top-K ASes from the IPv4
topology that are also among the top-K ASes in the IPv6
topology, for K=10, 50 and 100. This fraction has increased
from around 20% in 2003 to more than 60% currently. Until
2008, however, the top-K fraction for K=10 was signiﬁcantly
smaller than that for K=50 and K=100, indicating that the
largest ASes in the IPv4 topology were either not present
in IPv6, or were not among the largest ASes in the IPv6
topology. This diﬀerence has decreased sharply in the last
3-4 years – currently 60% of the top-10 ASes from IPv4 are
also in the top-10 for the IPv6 topology.

Common AS links
Finally, we are interested in the common set of AS links
between the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies. As mentioned in

Figure 10: Fraction of AS links from combined
(IPv4+IPv6) graph that are present in the IPv6
graph, classiﬁed according to business type of link
endpoints.

Section 2, our BGP vantage points are likely to miss some
AS links, particularly peering links lower in the hierarchy
than the Routeviews/RIPE BGP monitors. We are, how-
ever, interested in the fraction of links from the IPv4 topol-
ogy which were also seen in the IPv6 topology. The afore-
mentioned visibility issues should aﬀect both the IPv4 and
IPv6 graphs similarly, and hence our analysis should not be
impacted by missing peering links in the measured IPv4 and
IPv6 topologies. Figure 10 shows the fraction of AS links
from the combined topology that also appear in the IPv6
topology over time. We compute this fraction for all AS
links and also classify them based on the business types of
the endpoints. As with ASes, the fraction of AS links seen
in the IPv6 topology is less than 20% for the overall graph.
This fraction varies widely, however with the business type
of the AS on each end of the link. Links involving ECs are
the least represented in the IPv6 graph, while larger frac-
tions of links involving STPs, LTPs, and CAHPs are seen in
the IPv6 graph. This is again consistent with our previous
ﬁnding that the pace of IPv6 adoption is higher in the core
of the network but lags at the edge (represented by ECs).

6. EVOLVING DYNAMICS OF IPV4 AND

IPV6 INFRASTRUCTURE

Continuing to explore our hypothesis that a maturing
IPv6 network should look more like the IPv4 network, we
compare the evolution of routing dynamics in IPv4 and
IPv6.
In particular, we focus on the evolution of update
churn, correlation between the update churn seen from dif-
ferent vantage points, path exploration, and convergence
times in IPv4 and IPv6. We focus on these metrics for the
following reasons. First, we hypothesize that both IPv4 and
IPv6 should show a similar relation between update churn
and the size of the underlying topology. Second, due to busi-
ness relationships and dense interconnection among ASes,
churn becomes localized, and each vantage point does not
see the same set of routing events. Consequently, correla-
tion between update churn seen at diﬀerent vantage points
can serve as a measure of the maturity of the underlying net-
work and business relationships. Finally, previous work has
shown that end-to-end delays and loss rates are signiﬁcantly
higher during routing events [23]. It is thus useful to com-
pare the extent of path exploration and routing convergence
times during routing events. If these metrics are signiﬁcantly
worse in IPv6 as compared to IPv4, then it could deter the
adoption of IPv6.

6.1 Churn as a function of topology size and

vantage point

Interdomain routing scalability has been a topic of major
concern in recent times [24, 25] for two reasons – increas-
ing routing table size, and increasing rate of BGP updates
(churn). The latter can be a more serious concern, because
failing to process updates in a timely manner can trigger a
wide-scale instability and result in traﬃc blackholing. Some
of these concerns were put to rest by observations that churn
in the IPv4 topology grows slowly [26, 27], and at the same
rate as the underlying topology. More recently, however,
Huston [28] compared IPv4 and IPv6 BGP update time se-
ries and concluded that while IPv4 churn has grown slowly
(linear), IPv6 churn has been increasing exponentially. This
qualitative diﬀerence between the evolution of update churn
in IPv4 and IPv6 raised speculation on whether routing dy-
namics in IPv6 are fundamentally diﬀerent from those in
IPv4. In order to investigate these diﬀerences, we next com-
pare the evolution of BGP churn in IPv4 and IPv6. We
deﬁne churn as the rate of BGP updates received from a
vantage point (e.g., updates per day). This deﬁnition of
churn is consistent with previous related work in the area.

Churn as a function of topology size
To understand how churn has evolved with respect to net-
work size, we track the growth in the number of updates,
normalized by the size of the underlying AS topology. To
calculate this metric, we bin the total number of updates
per day into three-month windows, ﬁnd the median daily
churn (using the average daily churn gives similar results)
for each window, and divide it by the average number of
ASes in the topology during that time window. Figure 11
plots this metric for IPv4 (top) and IPv6 (bottom).

In IPv6 this number has remained mostly stable since Jan
2004 at ≈ 3 updates per origin AS, except at the AT&T
monitor which sees half that many. In IPv4, except for the
AT&T and NTT monitors, this metric stabilized in 2006
at ≈ 5 updates per origin AS. Other monitors that peer

with the Oregon-IX collector show similar behavior. We
hypothesize that the anomalies exhibited by the AT&T and
NTT monitors are caused by non-stationary periods, which
we conﬁrm by ﬁltering out noise from the AT&T time series
as described in [26] and plotted in Figure 11 (top panel) as
AT&T*. Similar to the other monitors, this ﬁltered AT&T*
time series exhibits a stable ratio of 5 updates per origin AS.
To summarize, while previous work has pointed to the
qualitatively diﬀerent growth trajectories of IPv4 and Ipv6
churn, we showed that churn in both protocols grows at the
same rate as the underlying topology. We emphasize that
understanding the evolution of update dynamics requires ex-
amining more than temporal evolution; we must also con-
sider the evolution of the underlying topology. Measuring
churn normalized by the size of the underlying topologies re-
veals a richer picture, namely that BGP update dynamics in
IPv4 and IPv6 are qualitatively similar and their growth is
a function of the growth in the number of ASes. Explaining
why the average number of updates per AS is 5 in IPv4 and
3 in IPv6 is an interesting open question. We believe that
this has to do with the nature of the underlying topologies
and prevalent operational practices such as business rela-
tionships and traﬃc engineering.

Churn seen from diﬀerent vantage points
The churn seen from diﬀerent vantage points can shed some
light on the maturity of the underlying topology, because
as ASes establish denser interconnections and enforce busi-
ness relationships, churn becomes more localized, i.e., some
routing events only aﬀect a limited part of the Internet.

We calculate the cross-correlation between all pairs of
daily churn time series in IPv6 and IPv4 respectively, for the
monitors in Figure 11. We use the non-parametric Kendall’s
τ rank correlation coeﬃcient [29], a measure of association
between random variables based on the ranking of their sam-
ple data. Kendall’s τ takes value in the range [-1,1]; a value
of 1 denotes a perfect correlation and a value of -1 denotes
anti-correlation. Figure 12 shows the calculated correlation

coeﬃcients between all pairs of IPv6 time series, as well
as between all IPv4 pairs.
IPv4 pairs show little correla-
tion, with τ values mostly below 0.4, but IPv6 pairs show
strong positive correlation, with τ values mostly above 0.5.
The lack of correlation between IPv4 monitors indicates that
churn is highly dependent on the location and conﬁguration
of the corresponding router. As stated earlier, this is likely
due to denser interconnection and enforcement of business
relationships in the IPv4 topology. We have studied this
eﬀect in our previous work, where we showed that correla-
tion between IPv4 churn time series doubles after ﬁltering
out updates triggered by routing events that aﬀect only a
limited part of the Internet [26].

To summarize, we ﬁnd that the churn seen by diﬀerent
BGP vantage points shows stronger correlation in IPv6 as
compared to that in IPv4. Two factors might contribute
to the stronger correlation between IPv6 time series than
in IPv4. First, the IPv6 AS graph is much smaller and
thus provides less isolation (i.e., routing changes will have
a larger scope of impact). A second possibility is that since
IPv6 deployment is still at an early stage, business policies
may be less enforced and monitored, which would also result
in less isolation of BGP messages. As IPv6 deployment pro-
ceeds, we expect both of these factors to change; the IPv6
topology is growing exponentially, interconnection is becom-
ing denser, and business relationships in IPv6 will start to
be enforced. Thus, we expect the correlation of IPv6 churn
seen from diﬀerent BGP monitors to decrease over time and
become similar to that in IPv4.

6.2 Path exploration and convergence times

Routing changes have diﬀerent outcomes. Some changes
result in the withdrawal (addition) of a preﬁx from (to) the
routing table. Other changes alter the reachability informa-
tion to a preﬁx (e.g. rerouting). In addition, routing changes
can be transient or long-lasting. The eﬀects of routing in-
stability on data plane characteristics such as loss rate have
been well studied [23]. It is thus important to compare rout-
ing changes in IPv6 and IPv4. But, ﬁrst we must identify
and group preﬁx updates that constitute a routing change.
When an underlying incident triggers a routing change, it
often results in several updates for each aﬀected preﬁx (i.e.,
convergence sequence). The duration of this convergence se-
quence is referred to as convergence time. A preﬁx event is
a sequence of updates for a given preﬁx that are likely trig-
gered by the same underlying cause. We use the deﬁnition

Time

Figure 13: Comparing path exploration and conver-
gence times (IIJ). The average number of updates
per routing change event gradually converges be-
tween IPv4 and IPv6. The average convergence time
in IPv6 is burstier, with a lower bound at a similar
level as in IPv4.

by Wu et al. [30] to identify preﬁx events: Two consecutive
updates for the same preﬁx belong to the same preﬁx event
if they are no more than 70 seconds apart. The maximum
duration for a preﬁx event is set to 10 minutes. Events with
duration longer than 10 minutes are considered to be ﬂap-
ping. These preﬁx events can be classiﬁed based on the
best known path to the aﬀected preﬁx before and after the
event [31, 32]. After identifying all preﬁx events in our time
series, we compute two metrics reﬂecting their impact: path
exploration (average number of updates observed per event)
and convergence time. When a route to a preﬁx fails, BGP
may explore several routes before converging to a new route
or withdrawing the preﬁx altogether. A longer path ex-
ploration extends BGP convergence time which will likely
impede data plane performance.

Path exploration
Path exploration is often more pronounced in events that
lead to a complete withdrawal of a preﬁx (AW events) [32].
The top panel in Figure 13 compares the average number
of updates per an AW event in IPv6 and IPv4 as seen from
the perspective of IIJ6. In IPv4, this number has mostly re-
mained stable below 4. We also observe a slight increase
in post-withdrawal path exploration after 2009.
In IPv6,
on the other hand, this number was around 10 updates un-
til early 2005,
it then decreased gradually and stabilized
around 4. When investigating AW events that took place
in the ﬁrst two years of the study period, we ﬁnd that our
monitors explored monotonically longer paths before send-
ing the ﬁnal withdrawal.
In IIJ for example, the median
length of the longest explored path was 18 hops in January
2004 and gradually dropped to stabilize around 7 hops in

monitor. Other monitors show qualitatively similar results.

2008. We can imagine two possible causes for this gradual
reduction in path exploration. First, ten years ago only a
few hundred ASes had deployed IPv6, and routing policies
may have been less enforced, allowing exploration of many
more alternative paths. Second, the early IPv6 graph was
sparser, so paths were naturally longer (see Figure 7), lead-
ing to proportionally longer convergence times (i.e., more
path exploration) [33]. The trends identiﬁed above are con-
sistent across monitors.

Convergence times
The bottom panel in Figure 13 shows the evolution of BGP
convergence time from the perspective of IIJ, measured as
the monthly average of all preﬁx event durations (i.e., the
time diﬀerence between the ﬁrst update and the last update
in an event). The average convergence time in IPv4 is sta-
ble around 50 seconds, but is higher and less stable in IPv6.
During 2004, IPv6 convergence time was slightly higher, sim-
ilar to the path exploration metric. We also recorded two
periods with sustained higher convergence times, in 2006 and
2010. A closer look at the data showed that the increase in
2006 was caused by one preﬁx that ﬂapped between two
paths that only diﬀered in the ATOMIC AGGREGATE at-
tribute (i.e., one path is announced as aggregated while the
other as not). The fact that a single preﬁx has a large impact
on the measured convergence time is surprising. However,
our data shows that the small size of the IPv6 routing system
makes it vulnerable to such eﬀects. The number of preﬁx
events per day rose sharply from ≈ 200 before this instabil-
ity to ≈ 350 due to the unstable preﬁx; this single ﬂapping
preﬁx experienced 150 instabilities per day. On the other
hand, the number of preﬁx events per day is two orders of
magnitude larger in IPv4 than in IPv6. When we exclude
events related to this preﬁx, the convergence time drops to
the same level as prior to the instability. A similar ﬂap-
ping that involved ﬁve preﬁxes caused the peak in 2010. We
believe that this activity was triggered by an IGP miscon-
ﬁguration in the origin AS. These peaks were evident in all
monitors, consistent with the earlier observed strong corre-
lation between IPv6 monitors. Apart from these anomalous
periods, IPv6 generally matched IPv4 in terms of conver-
gence time.

To summarize, the evolution of path exploration and con-

vergence time shows that the characteristics of routing changes
in IPv6 are gradually becoming similar to those in in IPv4.
This is an encouraging trend, as it suggests an increasing
maturity in IPv6 deployment. Furthermore, any performance
degradations resulting from routing changes in IPv6 should
be no worse than we see in IPv4.

IPV4 VS. IPV6 PERFORMANCE

Figure 14 plots the the relative performance as measured
by relative download times for all ﬁve vantage points we
use (method described at the end of Section 2). Conﬁrm-
ing the results of Nikkhah et al. [16], 79% of paths we ob-
served had IPv6 performance within 10% of IPv4 (or IPv6
had better performance) if the forward AS-level path was
the same in both protocols, while only 63% of paths had
similar performance if the forward AS-level path was diﬀer-
ent. However, our measurements (and theirs) are dominated
by the path RTT because the transfers are typically small
(although we only analyze measurements of transfers over
10K bytes). The dashed lines in Figure 14 plot the relative

Figure 14: Relative performance between IPv4 and
IPv6 measured by the relative mean fetch times
(solid lines) and minimum SYN/ACK RTT (dashed
lines). Because small pages (although over 10K
bytes) are fetched, performance is dominated by rel-
ative RTT. The annotations at x=0.1 represent the
points where performance is at least 10% worse in
IPv4 or IPv6. IPv4 and IPv6 performance is more
likely to be similar if the same AS-level paths are
used for both IP protocols.

RTTs measured to the same (IPv4 and IPv6) webservers; the
solid lines (relative fetch time) and the dashed lines (relative
RTTs) are barely distinguishable. When IPv6 performance
is better, it is more likely correlated with a diﬀerent forward
AS-level path. However, the correlation between RTT and
fetch time is weaker when IPv6 performance is better, for
reasons we do not yet understand.

Implications of correlation between performance and
topological congruence
The signiﬁcant correlation between data plane performance
between two endpoints and the congruity of the AS path
between them inspires us to ask: how far are we from topo-
logical parity between IPv4 and IPv6?

Recall from Section 4 that only 40-50% of AS paths are
actually identical. There are several reasons why the AS
paths in IPv4 and IPv6 could be diﬀerent – the ASes or AS
links seen on the IPv4 path may not be present in the IPv6
topology, or networks may simply choose diﬀerent routes for
IPv4 and IPv6. With the data available to us, we cannot
conﬁrm why the AS paths diﬀer; we can, however, measure
how much congruence between IPv4 and IPv6 AS paths is
possible today. For each link in an IPv4 AS path toward
a dual-stacked origin AS, we examine whether that link is
present in the IPv6 topology, regardless of the AS path on
which it appears. Figure 15 shows that currently, 60-70% of
AS paths could be identical in IPv4 and IPv6 without con-
ﬁguring a new BGP peering session, because for these paths
each IPv4 link is already present in the IPv6 topology, just
not yet part of an observable BGP-policy-compliant path
between the edges. We take a step further and examine
what would happen if each IPv6-capable AS were to estab-
lish equivalent peerings in IPv6 and IPv4. Figure 16 shows
the fraction of IPv4 AS paths where each AS on the path
appears in the IPv6 topology. If current IPv6-capable ASes

established equivalent peerings in IPv4 and IPv6, 95% of AS
paths could be identical in IPv4 and IPv6, i.e., for an AS
link on such a path, both ASes are present in the IPv6 topol-
ogy, and both ASes already peer in IPv4. If these ASes also
started IPv6 peering, we could see the AS paths converge.
These results are encouraging, but they are even more mo-
tivating when juxtaposed with performance measurements
which show IPv4 and IPv6 data plane performance is com-
parable when the AS paths are the same. Together, these
results demonstrate the undeniable beneﬁt of BGP peering
parity between IPv4 and IPv6 AS-level topologies.

8. RELATED WORK

Many attempts have been made to evaluate the status
of IPv6 adoption and penetration [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42, 43]. None have found signiﬁcant activity, even
though IPv6 has been implemented on all major network
and host operating systems. Current levels of observable
IPv6 activity fall well below 1% [40, 42, 43]. Google plots
a time-series of the percentage of Google users that would
access www.google.com over IPv6 if it had an IPv6 address,

547which moved from 0.1% in September 2008 to 0.6% in May
2012 [3]. By some accounts, IPv6 development is progress-
ing faster in Asian countries, e.g., China [44]. Notably, the
2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was the ﬁrst major world
event with a presence on the IPv6 Internet [45]. These mea-
surement studies were either focused on IPv6 capability, i.e.,
how many websites and clients were IPv6 capable, or on the
actual levels of IPv6 traﬃc on the network. In our work, we
have focused on IPv6 deployment at the level of organiza-
tions, represented in BGP as Autonomous Systems. Huston
and Michaelson [46] of APNIC examined a range of types of
data collected over four years (January 2004 to April 2008)
in search of IPv6 deployment activity. They analyzed inter-
domain routing announcements, APNIC’s web access logs,
and queries of reverse DNS zones that map IPv4 and IPv6
addresses back to domain names. All of their metrics showed
some increase in IPv6 deployment activity starting in the
second half of 2006, but they emphasized the data’s limita-
tions, since it mostly reﬂected some interest in IPv6 rather
than usable IPv6 support. More recently, Michaelson [47]
measured the disparity between IPv6 capability at the net-
work level, and IPv6 capability of end-users. Karpilovski et
al. [48] measured IPv6 deployment using data on address
allocation, BGP routing, and traﬃc. They concluded that
even though IPv6 address allocations were increasing, actual
traﬃc levels remained negligible. Huston [49] continuously
tracks the evolution of the IPv6 topology and routing, with
some high-level comparisons with the current state of IPv4.
Aben [50] provides an interactive look into the deployment
of IPv6 at the AS-level, further divided by country. To the
best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst work to compare and
contrast IPv6 evolution with that of the IPv4 ecosystem.

BGP update dynamics and scalability have been active
topics of research during the last decade or so, mostly for
the IPv4 topology, e.g. [33, 32]. Lately, however, there has
been some concern about the scalability of BGP interdomain
routing [25]. Huston [28] compared update churn in IPv4
and IPv6, and found that while churn in IPv4 does indeed
appear “ﬂat”, that in IPv6 increases exponentially. In this
paper, we compared IPv4 and IPv6 update dynamics, and
showed that they are qualitatively similar. The apparent
diﬀerence between the absolute volume of IPv4 and IPv6
updates over time is simply a function of the diﬀerent growth
rates of the underlying topologies – the IPv4 topology grows
linearly, while the IPv6 topology grows exponentially.

A recent measurement study by Nikkah et al. [16] com-
pared performance (measured in terms of web page down-
load times) over IPv4 and IPv6, with the goal of determining
whether the control plane or the data plane was responsible
for worse performance over IPv6. They found that while
the data plane performs comparably in IPv4 and IPv6, dif-
ferences in the control plane (routing) are responsible for
performance diﬀerences seen between IPv4 and IPv6. We
show web page download time is dominated by RTT because
the pages fetched are typically small, so these performance
measurements are dominated by delay rather than available
bandwidth. We also demonstrate there is signiﬁcantly more
gain that could be made with the existing ASes that have
deployed IPv6; if equivalent links are established in IPv6 as
in IPv4 then 95% of existing paths could be identical.

9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

With the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
now having exhausted its pool of available IPv4 addresses,
and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) scheduled to
run out in the near future, there has been growing inter-
est in how IPv6 is being deployed and used. In this paper,
we undertook the ﬁrst study of the evolution of IPv6 de-
ployment, comparing and contrasting it with how IPv4 has
evolved over the last decade and a half. Our ﬁndings hint
that the IPv6 network is indeed maturing, and while the
increasing pace of IPv6 uptake over the last two years is an
encouraging sign, IPv6 adoption is distinctly non-uniform,
both topologically and geographically. From the topologi-
cal perspective, IPv6 deployment is ahead in the core of the
network, driven by transit and content providers, while it
lags at the edges, which mostly consist of enterprise cus-
tomers. While the data at our disposal does not allow us
to study why deployment is lagging at the edge, we conjec-
ture that this is due to a lack of incentives for edge networks
to deploy IPv6, given available alternative strategies, e.g.,
NAT. For many edge networks, deploying IPv6 represents
a cost (transitioning infrastructure, training staﬀ, increased
management/troubleshooting overhead) without a tangible
beneﬁt. A single player, Hurricane Electric, predominates
the IPv6 topology signiﬁcantly more than the most predom-
inant AS in the IPv4 topology. This suggests that several
graph-theoretic metrics (e.g., average AS-path length) could
be signiﬁcantly skewed by the single large player in IPv6.
In terms of geographical trends, IPv6 adoption is higher in
Europe and the Asia Paciﬁc region. We conjecture that
adoption in the Asia-Paciﬁc region was spurred by IPv4 ad-
dress exhaustion, which happened ﬁrst in that region. A
big push toward IPv6 by network operators in the RIPE
region could explain why Europe is ahead of North Amer-
ica. From the point of view of routing dynamics, we ﬁnd
that IPv6 behaves mostly like IPv4. The diﬀerences in the
growth of the absolute volume of updates in IPv4 and IPv6
stem from the diﬀerent growth rates of the two topologies –
IPv4 now grows linearly in terms of ASes and preﬁxes, while
IPv6 grows exponentially. Finally, we ﬁnd that performance
over IPv6 paths is comparable to that over IPv4 if the AS-
level paths are the same, while it can be signiﬁcantly worse
when AS-level paths are diﬀerent. Interestingly, we found
that while only 40-50% of AS paths are currently identical
in IPv4 and IPv6, up to 95% of AS paths could be identical,
if current IPv6-capable ASes established equivalent peerings
in IPv4 and IPv6.

There are several avenues for future work. First, we plan
to keep collecting and processing topology and routing data
for both IPv4 and IPv6. We plan to release to the research
and operational communities periodic data tracking the evo-
lution of IPv6 topology and routing, to enable compari-
son with IPv4 evolution over the last 15 years. We expect
that such monitoring will become more useful as networks
move toward deploying IPv6 in production. In particular,
it will be interesting to measure if IPv6 deployment acceler-
ated following the World IPv6 Launch [51] event, scheduled
for June 6, 2012. Complementary to our eﬀorts in mea-
suring IPv6 deployment, we are developing a quantitative
model of IPv6 adoption at the organization level, which we
will parameterize and validate using our our ongoing mea-
surements. A crucial factor in determining whether IPv6
is widely adopted is the end-to-end performance achievable

548over IPv6, and whether that performance is comparable to
that achievable over IPv4. We plan to continue and extend
our current IPv6 performance measurements to identify or
rule out other causes of performance disparity beyond RTT,
such as loss, fragmentation, segmentation, and packet re-
ordering, and make results available to the community.
