ABSTRACT
The HTTPS certiﬁcate ecosystem has been of great inter-
est to the measurement and security communities. Without
any ground truth, researchers have attempted to study this
PKI from a variety of fragmented perspectives, including
passively monitored networks, scans of the popular domains
or the IPv4 address space, search engines such as Censys,
and Certiﬁcate Transparency (CT) logs. In this work, we
comparatively analyze all these perspectives. We ﬁnd that
aggregated CT logs and Censys snapshots have many prop-
erties that complement each other, and that together they
encompass over 99% of all certiﬁcates found by any of these
techniques. However, they still miss 1.5% of certiﬁcates ob-
served in a crawl of all domains in .com, .net, and .org.
We go on to illustrate how this combined perspective affects
results from previous studies. In light of these ﬁndings, we
have worked with the operators of Censys to incorporate CT
log data into its results going forward, and we recommend
that future HTTPS measurement adopt this new vantage.

INTRODUCTION

Nearly all secure web communication takes place over
HTTPS. Both the underlying TLS protocol and the sup-
porting certiﬁcate public key infrastructure (PKI) have been
studied extensively over the past ﬁve years, with questions
ranging from understanding the behavior of certiﬁcate au-
thorities [11, 14] to detecting server-side vulnerabilities and
tracking how quickly they are mitigated [7, 10, 28].

Such measurements are difﬁcult to conduct well, since
there is no comprehensive set of trusted certiﬁcates or of
HTTPS websites—no ground truth for studying this ecosys-

tem. Instead, researchers have attempted to gain visibility into
it using various fragmentary perspectives—such as scanning
the IPv4 address space [12], querying popular Alexa domains,
passively monitoring network trafﬁc [3], and querying Cer-
tiﬁcate Transparency (CT) logs [20, 21]. Each methodology
provides an imperfect view of the world, yet there has been
little work to analyze how they differ or how they might be
combined to piece together a more comprehensive picture.
Consider, for example, the different perspectives provided
by CT logs and the Censys search engine [8], two widely
used sources of certiﬁcate data. CT is designed to enable
auditing of trusted certiﬁcates by recording them in publicly
veriﬁable logs. While this may someday provide a complete
view of the certiﬁcate ecosystem, at present, publishing cer-
tiﬁcates to CT logs is voluntary in most cases. In contrast,
Censys provides a public database of certiﬁcates collected
by actively scanning the IPv4 address space and Alexa Top
Million domains. Although IPv4 scanning might seem to
promise an exhaustive view of certiﬁcates in use on the pub-
lic Internet, it misses several important cases, including those
served exclusively over IPv6. IP-based scanning also cannot
provide the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) header [13],
which speciﬁes the requested domain name and is necessary
when a server hosts multiple sites from a single IP address.
In this work, we comparatively analyze the certiﬁcates seen
by eight measurement perspectives: (1) a Censys certiﬁcate
snapshot, (2) an exhaustive IPv4 scan on TCP/443, (3) a scan
of Alexa Top Million domains, (4) a snapshot of public CT
Logs, (5) a scan of domains contained in these CT logs, (6) a
scan of domains contained in the .com, .net, and .org zone
ﬁles [30], (7) a scan of domains from the Common Crawl
dataset [6], and (8) certiﬁcates passively observed by the ICSI
SSL Notary using passive network monitoring [3].

Combining these datasets, we observe nearly 17 million
unique browser-trusted certiﬁcates that were valid during our
measurement interval, August 29 to September 8, 2016. Of
these, 90.5% appeared in public CT logs and 38.0% were
seen by Censys. To understand this difference, we investigate
the impact of SNI by attempting connections to 30 million
domains extracted from certiﬁcates in CT logs. Only 35%
of domains that accepted a connection with SNI offered the
same certiﬁcate when SNI was not used. This places an

Certiﬁcates in any of the perspectives above

Table 1: Certiﬁcate Perspectives—We compare eight distinct perspectives on the universe of valid certiﬁcates, spanning six
measurement techniques. Certiﬁcate Transparency (CT) is the largest perspective, including many certiﬁcates only seen in CT.

upper bound on the certiﬁcates observable by IP-based scan-
ning. Combining data from Censys and CT covers 99.4%
of all trusted certiﬁcates seen by any perspective we studied,
and may closely approximate the public HTTPS ecosystem.
However, as the vast majority of the certiﬁcates in our data
originate from these two sources, this number is suspect. To
better validate the fraction of certiﬁcates visible with these
perspectives, we consider certiﬁcates seen by scanning do-
mains from the .com, .net, and .org zone ﬁles, and ﬁnd
that the union of CT logs and Censys contains 98.5% of them.
Based on these results, we recommend that researchers
performing future HTTPS measurements use a combination
of data published in CT logs and Censys-style IPv4 scanning.
To facilitate this, we are working with the operators of Censys
to implement synchronization between Censys and CT logs.
Going forward, Censys will continuously incorporate certiﬁ-
cate data from public CT logs in its results and publish newly
discovered certiﬁcates back to Google CT logs, making either
data source a strong foundation for studying the certiﬁcate
ecosystem.
2. CERTIFICATE PERSPECTIVES

In order to compare techniques for measuring certiﬁcates,
we conducted six kinds of scans and analyzed two existing
datasets. Table 1 summarizes these perspectives, which we
describe in detail below.
Certiﬁcate Transparency Logs.

Certiﬁcate Transparency (CT) aims to allow public audit-
ing of trusted certiﬁcates [21]. Anyone can submit valid
certiﬁcates to CT log servers, which record them in cryp-
tographically veriﬁable public ledgers. Although there is
no universal requirement for submission, Google records
all certiﬁcates seen in its web crawls to CT logs. Chrome
requires all issuers submit extended validation (EV) certiﬁ-
cates to at least two logs [5]. Chrome recently mandated
that Symantec certiﬁcates signed after June 1, 2016, be sub-
mitted to be trusted as well [26]. Several CAs voluntarily
log all certiﬁcates they issue, notably Let’s Encrypt [23] and
StartCom [27].

We retrieved the certiﬁcates stored in twelve well-known
CT logs on September 8, 2016. These logs are operated by
Google (“Pilot”, “Aviator”, “Rocketeer”, and “Submariner”),

Digicert, StartCom, Izenpe, Symantec, Venaﬁ, WoSign, CN-
NIC, and Shengnan GDCA.

Censys Certiﬁcate Snapshot.

The Censys search engine [8] publishes daily snapshots of
all the certiﬁcates it indexes. Censys collects certiﬁcates by
exhaustively scanning the IPv4 address space without SNI,
and by connecting to all Alexa Top Million domains with SNI.
Our perspective is based on the September 8, 2016 snapshot.

Scan of FQDNs from CT.

We extracted the fully qualiﬁed domain names (FQDNs)
from all certiﬁcates in our CT log snapshots, covering the
common name (CN) and subject alternative name (SAN)
ﬁelds. We then used ZGrab [8] to attempt an HTTPS connec-
tion to each domain, with SNI enabled. The scan ran from
the University of Michigan on August 29 and September 6
and 8, 2016.

IPv4 HTTPS Scan.

We used the ZMap suite [12] to scan the IPv4 address
space for HTTPS servers listening on TCP/443. The scan
took place on August 29, 2016, from the University of Michi-
gan. For each listening host, we attempted a TLS handshake
and recorded the presented certiﬁcate chain. Since these
connections were based on IP addresses rather than domain
names, they did not include the SNI header.

Authoritative Zone Files.

We attempted HTTPS handshakes with all domains in the
authoritative zone ﬁle [30] for .com, .net, and .org do-
mains, for both the base domain and the www subdomain.
(Since the TLD zone ﬁles contain only the name server en-
tries for each domain, we learn only the base domain name.)
We ran these scans using ZGrab on August 29 and Septem-
ber 2, 2016, from the University of Michigan. There were
153 million unique domains in these zone ﬁles, and we com-
pleted 42 million successful HTTPS handshakes to the base
domains, and 40 million successful HTTPS handshakes to
the www subdomains. While we connected to many domains,
the certiﬁcates served were often only valid for the hosting
provider’s domain name and not the scanned domain.

544Common Crawl.

The Common Crawl project [6] aims to perform a regular,
complete crawl of public websites. We processed the January
2016 crawl and extracted 28.9 million unique domains. We
used ZGrab to attempt an HTTPS connection to every domain
on September 3, 2016, from the University of Michigan.

Alexa Top Million HTTPS Scan.

We used the ZMap suite to attempt connections to the
Alexa Top Million domains. The scan took place on Septem-
ber 3, 2016, from the University of Michigan. For each listen-
ing host, we attempted a TLS handshake with SNI enabled
and recorded the presented certiﬁcate chain.

ICSI SSL Notary.

The SSL Notary dataset consists of daily Internet trafﬁc
from approximately 180,000 users at ﬁve North American
academic or research institutions [3]. We analyzed 2.2 billion
TLS connections on TCP/443 from July 29 to August 29,
2016, extracting a total of 635,314 certiﬁcates. We excluded
incomplete connections as well as HPC, Grid, and Tor cer-
tiﬁcates, resulting in 386,051 certiﬁcates, of which 256,869
were trusted by the Mozilla NSS root store.

Due to a nondisclosure agreement that limited our internal
data sharing, Notary certiﬁcates are not included in cases
where we consider the union of all perspectives. This reduces
the size of the union by 0.02%.

In total across all these perspectives, we discovered 17 mil-
lion unique certiﬁcates that were valid and trusted by the
Mozilla NSS root store. Since the different datasets contain
somewhat different temporal perspectives, we consider cer-
tiﬁcates to be valid only if their date ranges cover our entire
collection period, August 29 to September 8. By constraining
our data in this way, we ensure that no data source contains
certiﬁcates that would be invalid in another data source due
to the time when the certiﬁcates were validated.
2.1 Ethical Considerations

For our active scanning, we honored the University of
Michigan’s institutional blacklist to exclude endpoints that
previously requested not to be scanned. We also followed the
best practices deﬁned by Durumeric et al. [12]; we refer to
that work for more discussion of the ethics of active scanning.
Passive data collection was cleared by the responsible parties
at each contributing institution. The ICSI SSL Notary stores
connection metadata (e.g., certiﬁcate and cipher information)
without collecting any connection payload.

3. RESULTS

Our certiﬁcate “universe” consists of 16,989,236 unique,
valid certiﬁcates from our eight perspectives. These certiﬁ-
cates contain 32,454,062 FQDNs from 12,673,515 sites (as
deﬁned by the public sufﬁx list [25]). The CT logs and Cen-
sys snapshot are the two largest datasets. The CT logs contain
15,374,936 certiﬁcates (90.5% of certiﬁcates observed in this
study). Censys sees 6,448,588 certiﬁcates— 38% coverage of

we observe and 99.7% coverage of sites.
3.1 Limits of Certiﬁcate Transparency

While CT is by far the largest perspective, it still misses
9.5% of the certiﬁcate universe, including 29.6% of GoDaddy
certiﬁcates and 28.4% of cPanel certiﬁcates, as shown in
Table 2. None of the CAs in the table submit domain validated
(DV) certiﬁcates to public logs. In contrast, CT captures
99.3% of CloudFlare certiﬁcates and 100% of Let’s Encrypt
certiﬁcates.

We also ﬁnd that CT is skewed towards web content and
away from other TLS-based services, such as webmail, that
might not be linked to by websites Google crawls. For ex-
ample, we ﬁnd that CT misses 20.8% of certiﬁcates with

main containing vpn. In contrast, CT only misses 4.3% of
certiﬁcates with the subdomain www.
3.2 Limits of Censys

The Censys snapshot only covers 38% of our certiﬁcate
universe. Two sources are responsible for approximately 64%
of the missing certiﬁcates. As shown in Table 3, 90.8% of
Let’s Encrypt certiﬁcates are absent from Censys, accounting
for 42% of the certiﬁcates missed by Censys and 23.5% of
the certiﬁcate universe. Let’s Encrypt submits all issued
certiﬁcates to CT, but it appears that many of these certiﬁcates
are inaccessible without SNI or are not served on public sites.
CloudFlare accounts for 17% of all certiﬁcates in this study,
but Censys misses 81% of these, resulting in an exclusion of
13.9% of the certiﬁcate universe. We manually conﬁrmed that
the vast majority of CloudFlare certiﬁcates are only accessible
through SNI. This intuitively makes sense because most
Censys certiﬁcates are found through IPv4 scans that do not
include SNI information.
3.3 Sites Requiring SNI

In order to directly measure the impact of SNI, we per-
formed two scans over all FQDNs contained in valid cer-
tiﬁcates in the CT logs. We scanned 30 million domain
names, and were able to complete successful HTTPS hand-
shakes with 68% using SNI. As shown in Table 4, only 77%
of domains that accepted a connection made with SNI ac-
cepted connections without it, and only 35% returned the
same certiﬁcate as when SNI was used. This further shows
that scanning without SNI misses a substantial fraction of
websites.

In order to understand if this discrepancy applies to com-
monly visited sites, we can limit the scope of our comparison

to certiﬁcates discovered through Alexa Top Million scanning,
as shown in Table 5. Even for these popular sites, IP-based
scanning misses 27% of certiﬁcates and 65% of sites, due to
a lack of SNI—a massive difference compared to the 0.7%
that Durumeric et al. found in 2013 [11]. Notably, scans
of CT and IPv4 combined provide 98.5% of the certiﬁcates
presented in our Alexa Top Million scan.

3.4 Passive Trafﬁc Monitoring

The ICSI Notary perspective is derived from passive moni-
toring of network trafﬁc. It only includes certiﬁcates actually
seen on the wire, and therefore differs signiﬁcantly from our
other perspectives.

In contrast to our active scans, passive monitoring contains
certiﬁcates from IPv6 connections. We encountered 822,338
server IP addresses in our Notary dataset. Of these, 8.2%
(67,725) were IPv6 addresses, comprising 13% of the ob-
served connections. There were 4,512 certiﬁcates that were
only encountered on IPv6 addresses, but only 218 of them
were not observed in any other perspective. This suggests
that IPv6 does not impact conclusions drawn from scanning
signiﬁcantly, but as our passive dataset is relatively restricted,
further measurement is necessary to verify this claim. Under-
scoring the importance of SNI discussed in Section 3.3, only
9.7% of connections in the Notary dataset did not use SNI.
In total, we saw 3,246,725 unique SNI values.

The Notary saw only 3,805 certiﬁcates that were not ob-
served by any other perspective. We believe these are due to
certiﬁcate changes during the longer passive measurement
interval. This is supported by the fact that only 34% of the
certiﬁcates were encountered at all during the last week of
the measurement interval. Furthermore, 75% were issued by
CloudFlare, which rotates certiﬁcates quickly.

Table 8: Top Certiﬁcate Issuers—The most common issuers differ depending on the perspective studied. Let’s Encrypt has its
highest popularity in CT Logs, cPanel only appears in the top ﬁve for zone ﬁle scanning, and IPv4 scanning yields a longer tail.

There were 68,700 certiﬁcates seen by our passive mea-
surement that were not present in Censys. They have a sim-
ilar composition to the certiﬁcates in CT logs that Censys
missed. 39% are issued by Let’s Encrypt, which requires
sites to frequently re-issue certiﬁcates. 20% are attributable
to Wordpress-hosted blogs and 13% to CloudFlare, services
that heavily depend on SNI and would therefore not be seen
by IPv4 scans.

Table 9: Rate of Vulnerability to FREAK—Vulnerability
rates measured by each methodology vary signiﬁcantly.

As Table 6 shows, combining data from CT logs and Cen-
sys yields 99.4% coverage of all certiﬁcates observed by any
of our perspectives and 99.7% of all FQDNs and all sites.
However, since these perspectives are also our two largest
data sources, this statistic may be artiﬁcially inﬂated.

Fortunately, scanning all domains in the .com, .net, and
.org zone ﬁle provides us with ground truth for all sites
being served on the root and www subdomain in those zones.
We can use this to understand what coverage each perspective
gives in these zones. While the zones do not contain all
subdomains or even all domain names on the Internet, they
are a large subset: 153 million unique domains. We compare
Censys data and CT logs over the certiﬁcates obtained from
the zone scans in Table 7.

Of these certiﬁcates, we ﬁnd 98.5% are obtained through
either Censys or CT logs. Since this is smaller than the corre-
sponding percentage for all certiﬁcates we observe, there are
likely certiﬁcates being hosted in other zones and in other sub-
domains not observed by any method we use. Therefore, the
coverage of IPv4 scans and CT logs on the entire population
of certiﬁcates on the Internet is overestimated by Table 6.

Conversely, the coverage of Censys scanning on the zone
dataset is increased to 54%, from 38% over all certiﬁcates
observed. This is potentially due to certiﬁcates in CT logs
that are not actively hosted on the Internet (e.g., intranet sites).
As a result, the Censys coverage of the entire population of
certiﬁcates on the Internet is underestimated by Table 6.

IMPACT ON HTTPS RESEARCH

A number of recent studies have used IPv4 and Alexa Top
Million scanning to measure how HTTPS is deployed in the
wild [4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 22, 28, 31, 32]. Our ﬁnding that IPv4
scans miss nearly two-thirds of certiﬁcates suggests that, if
these studies were performed today, they might not accurately
reﬂect the state of the Internet.

To provide a concrete example of the differences caused by
different perspectives, we present a survey of sites vulnerable
to the FREAK attack [28] in Table 9. The data comes from
scanning each of: the IPv4 address space, CT log FQDNs,
Alexa Top Million domains, our zone ﬁles, and domains
extracted from Common Crawl. For each set, we measure
how many responsive hosts are vulnerable.

The number of vulnerable hosts changes with each perspec-
tive we measure. The vulnerability rates range from 1.88% of
IPs vulnerable when measured by IPv4 scanning, to 4.54% of
IPs vulnerable when measured by our Common Crawl scan.
This variation demonstrates the necessity of considering the
perspective used when performing measurements.

We also observe differences when comparing the most
common certiﬁcate issuers seen in each perspective, as shown
in Table 8. We measure this by grouping certiﬁcates by their
issuer organization ﬁeld and manually deduplicating similar
issuer names. Different perspectives display differing views
on which CA is most popular. For example, Let’s Encrypt is
the most popular CA in CT, Common Crawl, and zone scans,
but it is ranked ﬁfth in IPv4 scans.

5. RELATED WORK

This work was inspired by a large body of research focus-
ing on the HTTPS ecosystem and supporting PKI [4, 7, 8,
10, 11, 14, 28, 31, 32]. These works have run the gamut of
HTTPS measurement, ranging from the certiﬁcate authority
ecosystem [11, 14] to cryptographic keys generated without
entropy [16], and how operators react to vulnerabilities [10].
In 2010, the EFF launched the SSL Observatory [14], in
which they performed a scan of the IPv4 address space over
a three month period in order to identify trusted certiﬁcate
authorities. Later, in 2011, Vratonjic et al. [31] crawled
the Alexa Top Million ﬁnding that only 5.7% of websites
correctly deploy HTTPS. The same year, Holz et al. [18]

547carried out a similar study, combining active measurements
of the Top Million from from several vantage points, with
data from passive measurement at a large research institution.
They brieﬂy compared the differences of their vantage points,
concentrating on differences caused by scan origins.

In 2013, Durumeric et al. [11] analyzed the state of the
HTTPS PKI by repeatedly scanning the IPv4 address space.
They brieﬂy considered how much of the Alexa Top Mil-
lion was only accessible using SNI, ﬁnding that, at that time,
SNI was not widely required. Other studies use data based
on websites on the Top Million [19], and scans of the IPv4
ecosystem [10, 15, 16]. Studies have also been based on com-
binations of Alexa sites, random domains, known phishing do-
mains data from passive network monitoring [1, 2, 10, 24, 29]
Most recently, studies have also investigated TLS deployment
outside of HTTPS [9, 17].

Our work does not focus on the questions asked by these
individual studies, but instead focuses on how these types
of studies should be measuring the HTTPS ecosystem. We
hope that by better validating different methodologies for
studying the HTTPS PKI, we can help future papers obtain
more accurate measurements.
6. CONCLUSION

Over the past ﬁve years, dozens of studies have measured
the HTTPS ecosystem and supporting PKI. Unfortunately,
without a clear ground truth, these studies pieced together
a view built on a series of fractured and imperfect method-
ologies. In this work, we investigated these methodologies,
ﬁnding that IPv4 enumeration no longer provides a represen-
tative view of how TLS servers are conﬁgured, due to SNI
deployment. IPv4 scans miss more than two-thirds of valid
certiﬁcates and associated measurements can differ dramati-
cally from site-based approaches. Certiﬁcate Transparency
provides a new perspective, which ﬁnds 90.5% of certiﬁcates
observed in this study, but is skewed towards a few author-
ities that submit the certiﬁcates they issue. We ﬁnd that a
more comprehensive yet readily accessible methodology is
to use a combination of CT and Censys data, which together
account for 99.4% of our observed certiﬁcates. To this end,
we are working with the Censys team to implement continu-
ous certiﬁcate synchronization between Censys and Google’s
CT logs, which will soon make either data source a nearly
comprehensive view of trusted HTTPS certiﬁcates.
