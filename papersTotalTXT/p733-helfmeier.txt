ABSTRACT
As the surplus market of failure analysis equipment contin-
ues to grow, the cost of performing invasive IC analysis con-
tinues to diminish. Hardware vendors in high-security appli-
cations utilize security by obscurity to implement layers of
protection on their devices. High-security applications must
assume that the attacker is skillful, well-equipped and well-
funded. Modern security ICs are designed to make readout
of decrypted data and changes to security conﬁguration of
the device impossible. Countermeasures such as meshes and
attack sensors thwart many state of the art attacks. Be-
cause of the perceived diﬃculty and lack of publicly known
attacks, the IC backside has largely been ignored by the se-
curity community. However, the backside is currently the
weakest link in modern ICs because no devices currently
on the market are protected against fully-invasive attacks
through the IC backside. Fully-invasive backside attacks
circumvent all known countermeasures utilized by modern
implementations. In this work, we demonstrate the ﬁrst two
practical fully-invasive attacks against the IC backside. Our
ﬁrst attack is fully-invasive backside microprobing. Using
this attack we were able to capture decrypted data directly
from the data bus of the target IC’s CPU core. We also
present a fully invasive backside circuit edit. With this at-
tack we were able to set security and conﬁguration fuses of
the device to arbitrary values.

INTRODUCTION

Smaller technology nodes in modern Integrated Circuits
(ICs) have ushered in many innovations in IC manufactur-
ing. In security ICs, the additional resources and complexi-
ties oﬀered by modern manufacturing processes have allowed
vendors to increase the security threshold of these devices.
The available resources are utilized to implement additional
sensors and countermeasures to thwart IC analysis. For ex-
ample, all embedded memories are encrypted on modern
security ICs [18]. Design rules applied to modern imple-
mentations ensure that security relevant signals are routed
on the lower metal layers of a device making semi- and fully-
invasive frontside analysis signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult to per-
form. One common countermeasure against such attacks are
meshes, redundant layers of metallization on top of the de-
vice itself. Meshes are commonly categorized as active and
passive. Passive meshes are simply additional layers of met-
allization designed to hamper semi-invasive attacks, such as
laser fault injection [4].

For the fully-invasive attacker, passive meshes can be con-
sidered an additional deprocessing step, while active meshes
are an actual preventative measure. Unlike passive meshes,
active meshes are signal-bearing interconnects that are eval-
uated to verify the integrity of the device. Common invasive
techniques, such as Microprobing and Focused Ion Beam
(FIB) circuit edits, risk shorting the mesh to other signals
on the device. Active meshes are commonly implemented
over multiple layers of metallization, increasing the likeli-
hood of a detectable fault. If the device is compromised and
a fault is detected in the integrity of the mesh, the device
can subsequently execute a mitigation routine that destroys
any secret data stored on the device. Mesh complexities con-
tinue to become increasingly elaborate. In [7], the authors
proposed stacking multiple IC dies to eﬀectively integrate a
high-density multi-metal-layer active mesh to fully encapsu-
late the device in the middle.

However, the additional cost as well as durability and
manufacturability concerns will likely exclude their appli-
cation in certain ﬁelds such as smartcards. Most devices
for security applications remain single die solutions. Nev-
ertheless, active meshes can be integrated onto single-die
solutions as well.
In [26], the ﬁrst public attack against
a modern multi-metal-layer active mesh was demonstrated.
Here an Inﬁneon SLE 66PE active mesh was circumvented.
This particular mesh consists of two layers of signal bearing
interconnects, with a passive mesh layer in between. To cir-

733cumvent the mesh a tedious FIB circuit edit was employed
to rewire the individual mesh traces, allowing for an open-
ing large enough to interface with traces within the central
processing unit’s (CPU) core directly.

Current implementations lack suﬃcient protection of the
IC backside. Hence, certain forms of semi-invasive analy-
sis are completely unimpeded when implemented through
the IC backside. Semi-invasive Photonic Emission Analysis
(PEA), for example, can be utilized to recover the intrinsic
emissions that occur when the transistor is switching [16,
22]. Such attacks are completely passive and cannot be de-
tected by the device. However, they also require the integra-
tion of millions of traces and can easily be thwarted by lim-
iting the amount of times an algorithm can be executed by
the target device. Semi-invasive laser glitching has also been
shown to be eﬀective from the IC backside [28]. However,
light sensors are commonly integrated into modern secure
ICs and can also trigger attack mitigation routines upon
detecting a laser spot.

In this work we present two successful fully-invasive back-
side attacks. Currently, no IC implementations protect the
backside of the device against fully-invasive attacks. Two
common goals of fully-invasive IC analysis is the exﬁltration
of decrypted data from the device’s core and changes to the
device conﬁguration and security settings. We were able to
successfully trench through a device’s bulk silicon substrate
and microprobe the data on the CPU core’s databus. We
succeeded in capturing decrypted data on the device as the
data had already been deciphered by the hardware decryp-
tion function at this particular location within the circuit.
We also successfully performed a backside circuit edit of
the device’s fuses by severing and connecting traces on the
ﬁrst metal layer of the device. The fuse bits are responsible
for storing the device’s security and conﬁguration settings
and could be set to arbitrary values by our attack. To the
best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate
successful attacks that utilize fully-invasive backside micro-
probing and a successful backside FIB edit. Our attacks cir-
cumvent all countermeasures currently employed in security
ICs. Countermeasures that protect against invasive attacks,
such as active meshes, are currently only implemented on
the frontside of the IC and do not protect against backside
attacks.

The main contributions of this work are:

Backside Permanent Circuit Modiﬁcation.
We successfully changed values stored within the device’s
conﬁguration and security fuses. Fuses are commonly used
to enable or disable certain functions on the IC, such as
On-Chip-Debug (OCD) facilities. By utilizing such a cir-
cuit edit, security features such as copy protection can be
circumvented.

Backside Data Exﬁltration.
We were able to successfully microprobe the device’s core
databus. The location we chose ensured that the data had
already been deciphered by the hardware decryption funci-
ton. By setting the voltage at the output of our probing
solution, or by tying the trace to a voltage rail on the de-
vice, the device can be prevented from executing branching
instructions. If the clock of the device is slowed down sig-
niﬁcantly the control ﬂow of the device’s execution can be
manipulated.

Mitigation techniques against such attacks.
We present several mitigation techniques that should be im-
plemented in future generations of ICs to make such attacks
signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult. A simple set of design rules can
be applied to the device to make such attacks signiﬁcantly
less cost-eﬀective for the attacker.

The rest of this work is structured as follows: In Section 2,
we provide additional background information on the con-
struction of modern ICs as well as their inherent vulnera-
bilities. Next, in Section 3, the details of our experimental
setup are presented including the steps necessary for sample
preparation. Our experimental results are presented and
explained in Section 4. We discuss the impact on current
generation and future IC implementations in Section 5. Fi-
nally we conclude the work in Section 6.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Terminology

The attacks introduced in this work penetrate all the lay-
ers of the device to various degrees. Hence, it beneﬁts the
reader to be familiar with the correct terminology. This
section provides an overview of terms used in the rest of
the paper and in Sections 3 and 4 in particular. This is by
no means an exhaustive overview, as this section contains
many generalizations. We encourage the reader to consult
respected works on the topic of semiconductor manufactur-
ing and IC failure analysis [19, 25].

Figure 1 depicts the construction of a modern IC as well
as the result of modiﬁcations to the circuit. Transistors,
consisting of drain and source diﬀused into the silicon (dark
gray) and gate oxide and gate material deposited above the
silicon (black), are formed adjacently.
In Complementary
Metal Oxide Semiconductor technology (CMOS) both types
of transistors are required. P-type transistors are generally
fabricated inside an n-doped well region, the n-well (medium
gray). The n-wells are approximately one to two microme-
ters deep. By comparison, the drain and source diﬀusions
are just two to three hundered nanometers in depth. The
gate is formed between source and drain by depositing ei-
ther poly-silicon or metal on top of the gate dielectric and
silicon substrate. Transistors are separated from each other
using various isolation technique. Older technologies used a
process called Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) to create
an isolation barrier, whereas modern technologies generally
employ a process called Shallow Trench Isolation (STI). The
STI (light gray), the n-wells and the drain and source dif-
fusions are situated within the silicon substrate itself. The
area consisting of the gate, the source and the drain is re-
ferred to as the active area of the transistor.

Individual transistors are connected with each other by
metal interconnects, situated above the transistor level (dot-
ted). These interconnects are often called metalization or
simply metal layers as they are stacked on top of the tran-
sistors.
In between two such metal layers, an inter-level
dielectric (ILD) or passivation layer is fabricated, isolating
the two metal layers electrically (light gray). To create elec-
trical connections between two adjacent metal layers, vias
are formed through the ILD. The connections between the
ﬁrst metal layer and the transistor devices are called con-
tacts. The number of alternating interconnect layers and
inter-level dielectric layers in ICs varies, depending on the

734process. Modern smartcards, for example, generally have 5-
7 metal layers, including meshes. Devices of the same family
requiring a lower security threshold, such as SIM cards, uti-
lize only 3-5 metal layers. In security terminology the side
of the device that contains the metallization is generally re-
ferred to as the IC frontside. The opposite side, which lacks
any active devices and consists solely of the silicon substrate
is referred to as the IC backside.

Modern ICs consist of many layers. Figure 1 illustrates
a total of seven layers of metallization on top of the gate
layer. Metallization is numbered from metal 1 to metal 7.
On modern security ICs such as the Inﬁneon SLE 66PE, the
metals 5, 6 and 7 form the meshes and shields. Meshes are
designed to make attacks such as microprobing and circuit
edits more diﬃcult.

2.2 Sample Preparation

Invasive attacks are generally classiﬁed by the amount of
sample preparation necessary to perform the attack. No
sample preparation is required to perform non-invasive at-
tacks. Partial or complete removal of the device package is
necessary for semi-invasive attacks. In addition to depack-
aging fully-invasive attacks result in destructive modiﬁca-
tions to the device [2].

In the past, invasive attacks were carried out through the
frontside of the IC. Smaller feature sizes, additional metal
layers and countermeasures, such as meshes and shields,
have made such attacks substantially more diﬃcult on mod-
ern security ICs. Additionally, design rules ensure that
security-relevant traces are placed on lower layers of the
device so that they cannot be probed as easily from the
frontside. Hence, backside attacks become much more sig-
niﬁcant as they can circumvent these security measures di-
rectly.

ICs are usually concealed inside a package material that
must ﬁrst be removed so that invasive analysis can be per-
formed. During frontside sample preparation, package mate-
rials, such as epoxy, are removed with wet-chemical etching
to avoid destruction of the bond wires and topmost met-
alization layers. Depending on the materials used in the
device package, diﬀerent chemicals or a combination of me-
chanical and wet chemical etching may be necessary. Sub-
sequently, an additional etching process is used to remove
the passivation layers of the device. However, passivation
layers can also be eﬀectively removed using the FIB sys-
tem directly. Nevertheless, certain types of devices, such as
smartcards, must be rebonded as epoxy removal leaves them
brittle. Moreover, frontside sample preparation is extremely
diﬃcult on devices that utilize ﬂip-chip packages.

In contrast, backside preparation can be performed by
mechanical milling or polishing of the device. With milling
machines, such as the Ultratec ASAP-1, the package mate-
rial and the silicon substrate are milled in a single automated
process without the need for wet chemical etching. During
this process the bond wires connecting the IC to the contacts
remain intact as they are located on the frontside of the de-
vice. Moreover, the backside of the device can be accessed
directly on most smartcard packages by simply removing the
ground contact. After polishing the silicon substrate down
to approximately 30 µm, the FIB is used to etch the remain-
ing bulk silicon material, see Figure 1. Mechanical thinning
of the silicon substrate speeds up the FIB circuit edit prepa-
ration signiﬁcantly but can also be potentially omitted [20].

Changes in contrast of the FIB image indicate the doped sil-
icon of the n-wells and are employed as endpoint detection
during FIB thinning. This allows for access to every cir-
cuit node without signiﬁcant degradation of overall device
performance [6, 21].

2.3 Invasive IC Analysis

Invasive attacks are particularly powerful as they can di-
rectly alter the control ﬂow of the program being executed
by the device. Such attacks can also target speciﬁc locations
of the device, for example, where the data has previously
been decrypted by the hardware. Reverse-engineering tech-
niques, such as automatic detection of gates, are employed
to identify vulnerable logic [17]. After vulnerable logic has
been identiﬁed, the inputs and outputs of the logic are tar-
geted. Semi-invasive attacks, such as laser stimulation have
been used to introduce momentary faults or adversely af-
fect the leakage characteristics of the circuit so that data
can be recovered non-invasively [23, 24]. Fully-invasive at-
tacks commonly interface with the circuit directly. Such
attacks are also capable of circumventing and disabling on-
die countermeasures and directly manipulating data as it is
processed by the IC. Two prevalent forms of fully-invasive
IC analysis are microprobing and FIB circuit editing. Micro-
probing is generally used for data exﬁltration, whereas FIB
circuit edits are used to permanently modify the circuit.

Invasive microprobing allows for an attacker to interface
directly with a target’s data bus [2]. From the frontside,
such attacks require an attacker to remove any layers of
passivation covering the signals of interest. Once the data
bus is contacted, the attacker can capture any data on the
bus during execution. In practice, microprobing is limited
by the amount of probing needles that can be simultaneously
placed on an IC. However, fewer needles can be used if data
is captured over multiple measurements [13].

One common microprobing technique is to use the nee-
dle to introduce static and dynamic transient faults to the
circuit [4]. It is possible to set certain bus lines to an arbi-
trary value by grounding or driving them. By using multiple
probing needles, an attacker can capture and manipulate
data on the bus simultaneously. A common microprobing
technique for readout of embedded memories is known as
memory linearization [2]. In most instruction sets, the op-
code encoding of branching instructions share a small set
of bits. For example, for the Atmel AVR architecture used
in both devices analyzed in this work, bit 15 is 1 for every
branching instruction [3]. Hence, statically or dynamically
setting bit 15 to 0, i.e. grounding it with a probing needle,
renders the device incapable of executing branching instruc-
tions during this period of time. Such techniques are used
to selectively execute branches. Meanwhile, other parts of
the processor architecture continue to function nominally.
The program-counter continues to count up making it pos-
sible to sequentially readout all the memory addresses of the
device [1].

FIB circuit edits are commonly performed in conjunction
with other invasive attacks such as microprobing. FIBs are
particularly useful when permanent modiﬁcations are neces-
sary. FIBs are widely used to selectively remove passivation
on an IC with a high degree of accuracy. A FIB circuit
edit can connect nodes on the device as well as sever the
connection between connected nodes. For example, code
linearization can also be achieved with a FIB by tying bus

lines to the ground and supply rails of the device. However,
data must still be extracted by probing the data bus.

One particularly powerful application of the FIB is the
manipulation of security sensors and circuits on the device.
The output of a security sensor can be cut so that it can-
not alert the CPU in case a fault is detected. FIBs are also
widely employed to circumvent meshes [2]. They can be used
to interface to layers of the IC that are otherwise buried un-
der metallization. Using such techniques, even multi-signal
active meshes can be rewired and an interconnect to a signal
of interest can be created using FIB deposition [26].

Invasive IC analysis techniques are regarded state-of-the-
art, yet they are only employed on the frontside of the de-
vice. By switching from frontside attacks to attacks through
the silicon substrate, only the necessary sample preparation
steps change. The attacks can otherwise be carried out in
a similar fashion.
In this work, we present the ﬁrst suc-
cessful micro-probing attack and the ﬁrst permanent circuit
modiﬁcation performed through the backside of the device.

3. SETUP

This section outlines the failure analysis equipment em-
ployed to perform the attacks introduced in this work. Two
diﬀerent ICs were attacked in our experiments – the At-
mel AT90SC3232C and the Atmel ATmega328P. The AT-
mega328P is a freely programmable microcontroller, whereas
the AT90SC3232C is a security IC with the standard ISO7816
interface. Both ICs utilize the 8-bit AVR architecture.
3.1 Sample Preparation

All samples used in this work were mechanically backside
thinned to approximately 30 µm of remaining bulk silicon
thickness using the Ultratec ASAP-1 semi-automated pol-
ishing machine, see Figure 1. Both devices came in standard
plastic surface-mount packages. The original packages were
retained as the mechanical thinning of the substrate could
be performed without depackaging the device.

The thinned devices were spin-coated with Ultratec’s FIB
friendly anti reﬂective coating (ARC) imaging ﬂuid to en-
hance imaging contrast and protect the devices from ag-
gressive chemicals during FIB processing. The devices were
inversely soldered to a custom printed circuit board (PCB)
that exposed the polished IC backside. The Hammamatsu
PHEMOS-1000 was used to produce reﬂective laser scanning
images of the ATMega328P. Points of interest were directly
identiﬁed in the reﬂective laser image, see Figure 6. For the
AT90SC3232 smartcard device, optical microscope images
of metal layers one, two and three had been acquired prior
to the experiments, see Figure 4.
3.2 Focused Ion Beam Preparation

The PCB carrying the respective device was then mounted
in the FIB vacuum chamber of the DCG OptiFIB. This par-
ticular FIB system integrates a coaxial-optical path directly
into the ion column allowing for optical microscope imaging
simultaneously to FIB processing. Though the optical sys-
tem simpliﬁes navigation and increases process control capa-
bilities during FIB editing, it is not mandatory for a success-
ful attack. The FIB is equipped with gases for IC modiﬁca-
tion including xenon-di-ﬂourine and iodine-based gases for
etching.
Insulator deposition gas and molybdenum-based
conductor deposition gas were used for deposition. FIB nav-
igation was performed using the coaxial optical column at

the bulk silicon material, the remaining device thick-
ness is comparable to the thickness of the frontside.
The device continues to operate nominally because
the active transistors are unaﬀected. Such prepa-
ration techniques yield the attacker access to any
signal on the device as they can expose every single
node of the circuit.

a wavelength where the silicon substrate is transparent, i.e.
1000 nm.
After identifying and navigating to the area of interest, a
FIB trench of 300 µm × 300 µm was milled down to the n-
wells, leaving approximately 2 µm of active device thickness.
The FIB trench surface was passivated by insulator deposi-
tion. At this stage, the device is fully-prepared for the FIB
circuit edit. Additionally, the substrate is suﬃciently thin
such that the contrast images reveal the potential diﬀerences
at the n-wells of the device, see Figure 7.
3.3 Backside Microprobing

Backside microprobing of the AT90SC3232C was carried
out on a dedicated probing station, see Figure 2. A Karl S¨uss
PA 150 probing station was used in conjunction with Karl
S¨uss PH 150 micro-manipulators and GGB T-4-10 probing
needles. To measure signals on the target device, the manip-
ulators were equipped with a simple probing buﬀer circuit
on a custom PCB. The probing buﬀer was designed to have
a very low input capacitance, ensuring that slew-rates of on-
chip signals did not degrade signiﬁcantly. Moreover, such a
setup makes it possible to probe even high speed signals.
Signals were captured using the Rigol DS4030 digital stor-
age oscilloscope.

4. RESULTS

The two devices used in this work diﬀer signiﬁcantly in
technology. The ATmega328P is a relatively modern mi-
crocontroller that utilizes shallow trench isolation (STI) to
separate individual transistors, see Figure 1 in Section 2.
However, the AT90SC3232C is fabricated in an older pro-
cess technology which utilized an isolation technique other
than STI. In general, we will refer to the manufacturing
process of the AT90SC3232C device as non-STI. Ironically,
even though the feature sizes of this device are signiﬁcantly

Figure 3: Endpoint images for the non-STI device
(left) and the STI device (right). The endpoint for
the milling process in both cases is the ﬁrst visi-
ble material contrast. For non-STI devices the ﬁrst
material contrast is between the gate material and
contact plugs. At this point the transistor has been
severely damaged. For STI devices, the ﬁrst ma-
terial contrast is the STI layer. At this point, the
devices retain full functionality with an active device
thickness of approximately 300 nm.

larger, performing backside FIB edits on this device is more
diﬃcult. The lack of STI makes determining the endpoint
of an etching process far more diﬃcult and requires an ex-
perienced FIB operator, see Figure 3.

Finding the approximate position of the point of interest
is possible using near-IR optical imaging. However, for the
subsequent circuit edit, a more precise sample alignment is
necessary. The diﬀerences in the fabrication of the two de-
vices resulted in diﬀerent alignment procedures for the re-
spective backside FIB circuit edits. The milling process is
continued in the vicinity of the point of interest. In case of
the STI device, the STI layer provides the ﬁrst material con-
trast in the secondary electron image and is clearly visible in
Figure 3 as the dark area surrounding the active transistors.
The STI contrast image allows for high precision alignment
of the order of tens of nanometers without damaging the
circuit.

Non-STI devices are damaged prior to reaching the ﬁrst
material contrast in the secondary electron image, see Fig-
ure 3. This is due to the fact that the depth of the isolation
used in older devices is signiﬁcantly less than in STI-devices.
Hence, for a successful edit of non-STI devices a location
must be carefully selected that contains no active devices,
which would otherwise be damaged during milling. Subse-
quently the device is thinned down until a metal layer is
exposed. The exposed metal can then be used for precise
alignment of the sample.

After achieving high precision alignment, the FIB CE was
carried out. Section 4.1 details the steps for contacting the
decrypted bus lines of the AT90SC3232C. In section 4.2,
the results of editing the fuse bits of the ATmega328P are
presented.
4.1 Backside Data Exﬁltration

For successful probing of non-STI processes, optical align-
ment must be used. From the optical image, the approxi-
mate position of the circuit edit location can be estimated.
Due to larger feature sizes of the non-STI processes, high
precision is not necessarily required for success. After ap-

737proximate optical navigation, metal interconnects on metal
2 can be exposed directly, see Figure 4. To verify the open-
ing of the correct interconnect, the pattern is compared to
the frontside optical microscope image acquired by delayer-
ing the device in a previous step. In our case, only a single
interconnect needed to be contacted. To ensure that only
the target metal interconnect is actually contacted, insulator
is deposited over all of the metal interconnects. The target
interconnect is then reopened and contacted using conduc-
tor deposition. Errors during this process can be corrected
in a subsequent edit. Hence, such a circuit edit is near-
foolproof. Figure 4 presents the circuit edit step-by-step.
The lower right image shows the ﬁnal result including the
conductor deposition to increase the contact area for the mi-
croprobing needle. Note, the circuit continued to function
nominally as microprobing has no adverse aﬀects on system
performance. Moreover if the attacker controls the system
clock any performance degradation from the additional ca-
pacitance of the probing needle can be compensated for by
reducing the system clock.

After modifying the device using the FIB, the device was
placed in the probing station. The probing needle contacted
the deposited conductor material, which in turn contacted
the target metal interconnect. The device was stimulated
by performing an ISO7816 cold reset of the device. The
device’s answer to reset was veriﬁed, and signal traces of
the data on the bus line was captured, see Figure 5.

4.2 Backside Permanent Circuit Modiﬁcation
Fuses are large single-bit non-volatile memory elements
that can be empirically identiﬁed in the corresponding laser
scanning reﬂective images, see Figure 6. All fuse bits had a
similar structure and layout. Other than the large ﬂoating
gate itself, each fuse consists of logic similar to the synthe-
sized logic elsewhere on the device. Each fuse circuit also
contained the analog circuitry necessary for programming,
reading and storing the fuse bit information.

After milling the area of the fuse bits down to the n-
wells, passive voltage contrast of the unpowered device was
used for navigation. The fuse bits are visible as regular
structures within the trench ﬂoor, see Figure 7. As the fuse
bit information is stored in a ﬂoating gate transistor, the
status will cause a minor alteration of the electrostatic ﬁeld.
This alternation can be detected by active or passive voltage
contrast depending on the conﬁguration, see Figure 7. For
passive voltage contrast, the device is unpowered and thus
incapable of preventing or detecting the operators actions.
When the device is powered up, higher potential diﬀerences
increase the contrast of the wells and the conﬁguration of the
ﬂoating gate, but also potentially risk detection by a circuit
with adequate attack sensors. As this particular device is
not equipped with backside sensitive FIB sensors, there is
no penalty for powering the device while reading out the
fuse conﬁguration.

Fuse bits are based on ﬂoating gate transistors, similar to
ﬂash or EEPROM memory. The characteristic diﬀerence to
other non-volatile memories is that fuse bits are generally
not addressed or read-out like other memories. Instead the
state of the fuse is used as enable signal for various circuitry
on the device. Common situations are clock and boot con-
ﬁgurations as well as security conﬁgurations to enable or
disable the reading of the device memory. There are several
possible approaches to set the fuses to arbitrary values. For

Figure 5: Captured trace and I/O interface status of
the Atmel AT90S3232 security IC. The traces were
captured on the backside prepared sample from the
FIB circuit modiﬁcation. A custom probing buﬀer
circuit was used for conditioning the target signal.

example, the read ampliﬁer or the digital output logic can
be modiﬁed or driven. We chose to modify the ﬂoating gate
structure as this structure is particularly large to facilitate
high-voltage programming.

As the device is fabricated in an STI process, precise align-
ment can be achieved upon reaching the STI layer, see Fig-
ure 8. In order to set the fuse arbitrarily, the ﬂoating gate
transistor is ﬁrst removed, yielding a programmed fuse bit,
according to the vendors terminology. Conversely, the fuse
bit can be erased by depositing a conductive trace between
the ﬂoating gate transistor’s drain and source contact plugs,
see Figure 9. These two circuit edit modiﬁcations can be
performed multiple times on the same fuse bit, allowing for
fuse states to be changed indeﬁnitely. As the transistor is
hard-wired to either on-state (conductor deposited) or oﬀ-
state (transistor removed), the fuse bit can no longer be
electrically programmed or erased. Thus, the speciﬁed func-
tion of the fuse bit is irreparably damaged by the circuit
edit. However, since fuse bits are generally not modiﬁed
during product life time, such an edit does not aﬀect the
overall functionality of the device. After altering the fuse
bit state to either programmed or erased state, the device
copy-protection mechanisms can be circumvented, yielding
any secret information stored on the device.

Mega328P. The device contains a total of 40 fuse
bits in the highlighted area. Each fuse bit consists

5. DISCUSSION

In Section 4 we presented two fully-invasive attacks against
modern ICs. In this section we consider the implications of
these attacks.
5.1 Data Exﬁltration

We successfully performed fully-invasive backside data ex-
ﬁltration. To achieve this, the data bus signals on the metal
2 layer of the device were contacted. A probing needle con-
nected to a simple probing buﬀer circuit was used to recover
the data. The AT90SC3232C implements several modern
security features. First of all, non-volatile memories of the
device, i.e. the program memory, are encrypted. Hence, an
attacker cannot decipher the program memory without ﬁrst
reverse engineering the encryption function and recovering
the secret key. However, the data must also be deciphered in
the core of the device as the CPU cannot execute encrypted
data. Hence, our attack focused on a location within the
CPU core where the data had already been deciphered by
the hardware decryption function.

Our buﬀer-ampliﬁer design included jumpers with which
the probing needle could be grounded or set to the sup-
ply voltage of target. By setting the needle to a particular
voltage, signals on the data bus of the target device can be
overridden. For example, by grounding the signal, a logical 0
would subsequently be latched by the corresponding instruc-
tion register of the device. Since the AT90SC3232C utilizes
the 8-bit AVR architecture, our attack targeted bit 15 of
the data bus. This technique is widely used in memory lin-
earization attacks where particular bus bits are overridden
so that arbitrary instructions are latched [2]. The encoding
of 8-bit AVR opcodes is such that all branching instructions
are encoded with a 1 at bit 15.
In the simplest memory
linearization attack, the attacker simply grounds the line
correspond to bit 15 ensuring that branching instructions
are no longer decoded properly. The other bus lines remain
unaﬀected. By dynamically driving the needle it is possible
to selectively execute branches and alter the control ﬂow of
the program. With an additional FIB circuit edit memory
linearization and microprobing of bit 15 can be performed
simultaneously. The bus line can be severed from the out-
put of the instruction register and tied to the ground rail so
that a 0 will be statically latched by the core. Meanwhile,
the valid output of the instruction register can be probed.
5.2 Permanent Circuit Modiﬁcation

Many security countermeasures are implemented as hard-
ware functions on modern security ICs. The fully-invasive
backside circuit edit targeted the fuse bits of the Atmel AT-
Mega328P. The ATMega328P utilizes the fuses to set certain
device parameters such as clock conﬁguration and startup
delay. However these fuses also are responsible for storing
security conﬁguration parameters of the device, such as lock
bits for controlling access to program memory. We success-
fully set the values stored in the fuses without utilizing the
device’s programming interface. Hence, our fully-invasive
edit is capable of circumventing the copy protection imple-
mented by the vendor. By setting fuse bits accordingly the
contents of the device can be extracted over the serial pro-
gramming interface even if it had previously been disabled.
For this attack, the ﬂoating gate transistor was completely
removed. Next, source and drain contacts of the device were
either statically connected or disconnected, corresponding to

740the fuse bit being set or cleared. The same attack can be
applied to other fuse technologies as well.

5.3 Countermeasures and Attack Mitigation
FIB circuit edits continue to be one of the biggest threats
to IC security. To successfully perform such attacks the
layout of the IC must ﬁrst be reverse-engineered. Several
approaches for reverse-engineering ICs have been proposed
in previous works [14, 16, 17]. In reality, for most attacks
it is suﬃcient to reverse-engineer just the datapath between
non-volatile memory and the CPU core. Since the core can-
not operate on encrypted data, the datapath by deﬁnition
includes all the necessary decryption functions.

In [26], a frontside attack against a secure smart-card was
demonstrated. The IC included both passive and active
meshes as well as sensors to detect attacks. Security rel-
evant signals were routed on the second metal layer. To at-
tack the device, the security mechanisms ﬁrst had to be cir-
cumvented, including rewiring the active mesh that covered
the relevant area on the device. By contrast, the backside
of the device lacked any protection mechanisms and many
sensitive device nodes are directly exposed from the back-
side. Every single circuit node is directly accessible from the
backside by contacting either the metallization or the tran-
sistor directly [6, 21]. As such, every signal on the device is
susceptible to backside microprobing attacks.

Ironically, older generation ICs that lack STI are more
diﬃcult to attack from the backside. To microprobe the bus
of the non-STI device, a site was isolated where the relevant
signals were routed through an inactive area of the device.
A relatively large FIB trench of several micrometers in size
was then milled to expose the individual interconnect line.
The size of the trench was suﬃcient to place the probing nee-
dle directly into the cavity. A much smaller trench could be
milled if the trace was instead contacted with metal deposi-
tion. Nevertheless, ﬁnding a suitable location for the trench
can be made signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult if the bus line ser-
pentined over active areas of the device. Note, that this is
only true for non-STI processes as the risk of misalignment
makes contacting transistors directly impractical.

Modern ICs utilize STI. The STI layer oﬀers an excellent
reference for navigation without the risk of damaging the
active devices.
In an STI process, the transistors can be
contacted directly, without the need to contact the metal
interconnects. Hence, STI processes are at greater risk for
successful microprobing.

Though, technically possible, practically contacting tran-
sistor nodes directly becomes more diﬃcult for smaller pro-
cess technologies. The success of the attack is largely deter-
mined by quality and generation of the equipment utilized
by the attacker. In this work a ten year old FIB was used
to successfully perform attacks on devices that were ﬁve to
ten years old. Latest generation FIBs are entirely capable of
performing circuit edits even on the latest technology nodes.
Moreover, IC vendors regularly utilize FIBs for failure anal-
ysis applications on their latest generation ICs. These ap-
plications include circuit edits similar to those presented in
this work.

However, the biggest threat posed to secure ICs are FIBs
that are available on the worldwide surplus markets. Utiliz-
ing second-hand failure analysis equipment is signiﬁcantly
more cost-eﬀective than purchasing new equipment. Such
devices are generally at least one generation behind what is

currently available on the market, but cost only a fraction
of the price of new equipment.

Substantially less accuracy is necessary to contact the
metallization. Moreover, only the inputs and outputs of
a gate contain valid data. In standard cell design, input and
outputs are generally routed on the ﬁrst and second metal
layer. These metal layers are substantially larger than the
the minimal gate length in a given process technology and
are directly exposed to attacks from the backside. Hence,
even an older generation FIB is suﬃcient to contact the
metal layers even of the most modern processes. For this
reason, design rules should be applied to security relevant
parts of the IC to make it more diﬃcult to contact the tar-
get signals. To protect against frontside attacks, security
relevant signals are buried in lower metal layers of the de-
vice. Hence, the attacker is ﬁrst forced to remove and rewire
any traces that cover the target signals. To protect against
backside circuit edits, sensitive signals should be made as
small as possible. One way to achieve this is to only use
low-fanout gates, which are intrinsically smaller than other
logic gates. Similarly, routing sensitive signals only locally
reduces the attack surface for the signal. Furthermore, if
sensitive nodes are only routed above active areas, a back-
side attack becomes extremely challenging as the attacker is
forced to contact transistors directly.

Fully-invasive backside attacks also allow for permanent
modiﬁcation of the target circuit. Modern secure ICs im-
plement a set of hardware countermeasures and defenses
against fully-invasive attacks. Such defenses generally raise
an exception to the CPU core or reset the device, potentially
irreparably destroying any secret data stored on the device.
However, since such security sensors are exposed from the
backside, a skillful attacker can disable any sensors and sub-
sequently probe the device without any penalty. In many
cases for a successful backside circuit edit, it is suﬃcient to
remove the hardware function entirely. For example, the cir-
cuit responsible for evaluating the integrity of an active mesh
can be modiﬁed or completely removed and its outputs tied
to static logic levels. Alternatively the state can be dynam-
ically evaluated in software. However, because the attacker
controls the data bus, any software countermeasures can be
circumvented as well [26]. In this fashion active meshes as
well as other device countermeasures can be completely dis-
abled as even a compromised circuit will pass the integrity
checks implemented on the IC.

Fuses are an example of such a hardware security func-
tion. In our experiments we succeeded in setting fuse bits
to arbitrary values. Fuses are particularly relevant to secu-
rity as fuses are often used to implement features such as
copy-protection and permanently disabling On-Chip-Debug
(OCD) facilities. Fuses are also commonly used as non-
volatile memory for key storage as they can be programmed
during device personalization. The fuses on most modern
Atmel devices are protected by a passive mesh from the
frontside of the IC. This is to prevent semi-invasive attacks
such as laser fault injection and add additional steps to at-
tacks from the frontside. From the backside, the fuses are
completely exposed. We succeeded in reading out the values
stored in the fuses without adversely aﬀecting the circuit.
Subsequently the fuses could be permanently modiﬁed by
connecting and severing the ﬂoating gate transistor accord-
ingly. Such an attack can also be directly applied to disable
various security sensors on the device.

741To protect against malicious backside circuit edits, back-
side integrity checks must be implemented [7].
Intrinsic
properties and special coatings can be utilized to detect
compromise of the IC backside [27]. However even these
measures do not completely prevent invasive attacks. Such
countermeasures can still be defeated by attacking the cir-
cuitry responsible integrity veriﬁcation. From a theoretical
point of view, for a truly secure device, the secret data must
be intrinsically linked to a tamper evident property of the
device. Any physical alternations to the device must render
the device inoperable, for example by irreparably altering
the key material. Physical Random Functions (PUF) are a
promising ﬁeld of research as the key material can be created
from their response. However, PUFs have also been shown
to be susceptible to semi- and fully-invasive attacks [9, 15].
Other information security approaches also provide poten-
tial solutions [5, 8, 10, 11, 12].

6. CONCLUSION

This work demonstrated the ﬁrst practical fully-invasive
backside attacks. Our ﬁrst attack, backside microprobing,
can be utilized for recovering data from the IC. Encryp-
tion implemented on modern devices can be circumvented
by recovering unencrypted data from locations where the
data has already been deciphered by the hardware. We suc-
ceeded in microprobing data deciphered by the hardware
decryption function within the device’s core. The second
attack is a permanent backside circuit modiﬁcation. Such
circuit edits can be utilized for disabling hardware security
functions and countermeasures. We succeeded in reading
out and setting the device’s conﬁguration and security fuses
to arbitrary values.

This work highlights the need for vendors to consider the
threat of backside attacks as well. Currently, IC implemen-
tations lack protection of the IC backside. On high-security
ICs countermeasures such as meshes make frontside invasive
attacks diﬃcult. One of the simplest solutions to make back-
side attacks signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult is to apply eﬀective
design rules on security relevant logic. By routing security
relevant logic above active devices, the traces themselves
are obstructed by the dense ﬁrst layer of metallization as
well as the gate materials. Another potential solution is
to implement a mesh for the IC backside. One such solu-
tion was presented in [7], where a 3D mesh was introduced
by stacking multiple dies. Though such a solution would
be substantially more expensive than a single die solution
it would essentially thwart any practical attacks known to
date. It is technically possible to disconnect two individual
dies or mill through multiple dies, however neither option is
cost-eﬀective for the attacker. Finally, by utilizing intrinsic
properties of the device it is possible to implement schemes
in which the device’s unique secret key changes from the
fully-invasive modiﬁcations performed by our attacks [27].
