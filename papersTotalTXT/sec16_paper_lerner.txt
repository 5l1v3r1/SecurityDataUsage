Abstract

Though web tracking and its privacy implications have
received much attention in recent years, that attention
has come relatively recently in the history of the web
and lacks full historical context.
In this paper, we
present longitudinal measurements of third-party web
tracking behaviors from 1996 to present (2016). Our
tool, TrackingExcavator, leverages a key insight:
that
the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine opens the pos-
sibility for a retrospective analysis of tracking over time.
We contribute an evaluation of the Wayback Machine’s
view of past third-party requests, which we ﬁnd is im-
perfect — we evaluate its limitations and unearth lessons
and strategies for overcoming them. Applying these
strategies in our measurements, we discover (among
other ﬁndings) that third-party tracking on the web has
increased in prevalence and complexity since the ﬁrst
third-party tracker that we observe in 1996, and we see
the spread of the most popular trackers to an increasing
percentage of the most popular sites on the web. We ar-
gue that an understanding of the ecosystem’s historical
trends — which we provide for the ﬁrst time at this scale
in our work — is important to any technical and policy
discussions surrounding tracking.

Third-party web tracking is the practice by which third
parties like advertisers, social media widgets, and web-
site analytics engines — embedded in the ﬁrst party sites
that users visit directly — re-identify users across do-
mains as they browse the web. Web tracking, and the
associated privacy concerns from tracking companies
building a list of sites users have browsed to, has inspired
a signiﬁcant and growing body of academic work in the
computer security and privacy community, attempting to
understand, measure, and defend against such tracking
(e.g., [3, 4, 6, 8, 14, 15, 18–20, 22, 24, 25, 27–30, 32–
34, 37, 39–43, 45, 46, 51, 57, 60, 61, 64–66, 70, 71]).

However, the research community’s interest in web
tracking comes relatively recently in the history of web.
To our knowledge, the earliest measurement studies be-
gan in 2005 [42], with most coming after 2009 — while
display advertising and the HTTP cookie standard date
to the mid-1990s [44, 48]. Though numerous studies
have now been done, they typically consist of short-term
measurements of speciﬁc tracking techniques. We ar-
gue that public and private discussions surrounding web
tracking — happening in technical, legal, and policy are-
nas (e.g., [49, 72]) — ought to be informed not just by a
single snapshot of the web tracking ecosystem but by a
comprehensive knowledge of its trajectory over time. We
provide such a comprehensive view in this paper, con-
ducting a measurement study of third-party web tracking
across 20 years since 1996.

Measurement studies of web tracking are critical to
technologists, policy-
provide transparency for users,
makers, and even those sites that include trackers, to help
them understand how user data is collected and used, to
enable informed decisions about privacy, and to incen-
tivize companies to consider privacy. However, the web
tracking ecosystem is continuously evolving, and others
have shown that web privacy studies at a single point in
time may only temporarily reduce the use of speciﬁc con-
troversial tracking techniques [63]. While one can study
tracking longitudinally starting in the present, as we and
others have (e.g., [42, 63]), ideally any future develop-
ments in the web tracking ecosystem can be contextu-
alized in a comprehensive view of that ecosystem over
time — i.e., since the very earliest instance of tracking
on the web. We provide that longitudinal, historical con-
text in this paper, asking: how has the third-party web
tracking ecosystem evolved since its beginnings?

To answer this question, we apply a key insight: the
Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine [31] enables a ret-
rospective analysis of third-party tracking on the web

over time. The Wayback Machine1 contains archives of
full webpages, including JavaScript, stylesheets, and em-
bedded resources, dating back to 1996. To leverage this
archive, we design and implement a retrospective track-
ing detection and analysis platform called TrackingEx-
cavator (Section 3), which allows us to conduct a lon-
gitudinal study of third-party tracking from 1996 to
present (2016). TrackingExcavator logs in-browser be-
haviors related to web tracking, including:
third-party
requests, cookies attached to requests, cookies program-
matically set by JavaScript, and the use of other relevant
JavaScript APIs (e.g., HTML5 LocalStorage and APIs
used in browser ﬁngerprinting [15, 57], such as enumer-
ating installed plugins). TrackingExcavator can run on
both live as well as archived versions of websites.

Harnessing the power of the Wayback Machine for our
analysis turns out to be surprisingly challenging (Sec-
tion 4). Indeed, a key contribution of this paper is our
evaluation of the historical data provided by the Way-
back Machine, and a set of lessons and techniques for
extracting information about trends in third-party con-
tent over time. Through a comparison with ground truth
datasets collected in 2011 (provided to us by the authors
of [60]), 2013, 2015, and 2016, we ﬁnd that the Way-
back Machine’s view of the past, as it relates to included
third-party content, is imperfect for many reasons, in-
cluding sites that were not archived due to robots.txt
restrictions (which are respected by the Wayback Ma-
chine’s crawlers), the Wayback Machine’s occasional
failure to archive embedded content, as well as site re-
sources that were archived at different times than the top-
level site. Though popular sites are typically archived
at regular intervals, their embedded content (including
third-party trackers) may thus be only partially repre-
sented. Whereas others have observed similar limita-
tions with the Wayback Machine, especially as it relates
to content visible on the top-level page [10, 38, 53], our
analysis is focused on the technical impact of missing
third-party elements, particularly with respect to track-
ing. Through our evaluation, we characterize what the
Wayback Machine lets us measure about the embedded
third parties, and showcase some techniques for best us-
ing the data it provides and working around some of its
weaknesses (Section 4).

After evaluating the Wayback Machine’s view into the
past and developing best practices for using its data, we
use TrackingExcavator to conduct a longitudinal study
of the third-party web tracking ecosystem from 1996-
2016 (Sections 5). We explore how this ecosystem has
changed over time, including the prevalence of different
web tracking behaviors, the identities and scope of pop-
ular trackers, and the complexity of relationships within

1https://archive.org

the ecosystem. Among our ﬁndings, we identify the ear-
liest tracker in our dataset in 1996 and observe the rise
and fall of important players in the ecosystem (e.g., the
rise of Google Analytics to appear on over a third of all
popular websites). We ﬁnd that websites contact an in-
creasing number of third parties over time (about 5% of
the 500 most popular sites contacted at least 5 separate
third parties in early 2000s, whereas nearly 40% do so
in 2016) and that the top trackers can track users across
an increasing percentage of the web’s most popular sites.
We also ﬁnd that tracking behaviors changed over time,
e.g., that third-party popups peaked in the mid-2000s and
that the fraction of trackers that rely on referrals from
other trackers has recently risen.

Taken together, our ﬁndings show that third-party web
tracking is a rapidly growing practice in an increasingly
complex ecosystem — suggesting that users’ and policy-
makers’ concerns about privacy require sustained, and
perhaps increasing, attention. Our results provide hith-
erto unavailable historical context for today’s technical
and policy discussions.

In summary, our contributions are:
1. TrackingExcavator, a measurement infrastruc-
ture for detecting and analyzing third-party web
tracking behaviors in the present and — leveraging
the Wayback Machine — in the past (Section 3).

2. An in-depth analysis of the scope and accuracy
of the Wayback Machine’s view of historical web
tracking behaviors and trends, and techniques for
working around its weaknesses (Section 4).

3. A longitudinal measurement study of third-party
cookie-based web tracking from 1996 to present
(2016) — to the best of our knowledge, the longest
longitudinal study of tracking to date (Section 5).

2 Background and Motivation
Third-party web tracking is the practice by which enti-
ties (“trackers”) embedded in webpages re-identify users
as they browse the web, collecting information about the
websites that they visit [50, 60]. Tracking is typically
done for the purposes of website analytics, targeted ad-
vertising, and other forms of personalization (e.g., so-
cial media content). For example, when a user vis-
its www.cnn.com, the browser may make additional re-
quests to doubleclick.net to load targeted ads and
to facebook.com to load the “Like” button; as a re-
sult, Doubleclick and Facebook learn about that user’s
visit to CNN. Cookie-based trackers re-identify users by
setting unique identiﬁers in browser cookies, which are
then automatically included with requests to the tracker’s
domain. Figure 1 shows a basic example; we discuss

preﬁxes from request and referrer URLs, and ﬁlling our
simulated cookie jar (described further below). During
the replay, TrackingExcavator analyzes each event for
tracking behaviors.
Classifying Tracking Behaviors.
For cookie-based
trackers, we base our analysis on a previously published
taxonomy [60].2 We summarize — and augment — that
taxonomy here. Note that a tracker may fall into multiple
categories, and that a single tracker may exhibit different
behaviors across different sites or page loads:

1. Analytics Tracking: The tracker provides a script
implements website analytics functionality.
that
Analytics trackers are characterized by a script,
sourced from a third party but run in the ﬁrst-party
context, that sets ﬁrst-party cookies and later leaks
those cookies to the third-party domain.

2. Vanilla Tracking: The tracker is included as a third
party (e.g., an iframe) in the top-level page and uses
third-party cookies to track users across sites.

3. Forced Tracking: The tracker forces users to visit its
domain directly — for example, by opening a popup
or redirecting the user to a full-page ad — allowing
it to set cookies from a ﬁrst-party position.

4. Referred Tracking: The tracker relies on another
tracker to leak unique identiﬁers to it, rather than
on its own cookies.
In a hypothetical example,
adnetwork.com might set its own cookie, and then
explicitly leak that cookie in requests to referred
tracker ads.com. In this case, ads.com need not
set its own cookies to perform tracking.

5. Personal Tracking: The tracker behaves like a
Vanilla tracker but is visited by the user directly in
other contexts. Personal trackers commonly appear
as social widgets (e.g., “Like” or “tweet” buttons).
In addition to these categories previously intro-
duced [60], we discovered an additional type of tracker
related to but subtly different from Analytics tracking:

6. Referred Analytics Tracking: Similar to an Analyt-
ics tracker, but the domain which sets a ﬁrst-party
cookie is different from the domain to which the
ﬁrst-party cookie is later leaked.

Beyond cookie-based tracking behaviors, we also con-
sider the use of ﬁngerprint-related JavaScript APIs, as
described above. Though the use of these APIs does
not necessarily imply that the caller is ﬁngerprinting the
user — we know of no published heuristic for determin-
ing ﬁngerprinting automatically — but the use of many
such APIs may suggest ﬁngerprint-based tracking.

Finally, in our measurements we also consider third-
party requests that are not otherwise classiﬁed as track-
2We are not aware of other taxonomies of this granularity for

cookie-based tracking.

ers. If contacted by multiple domains, these third-parties
have the ability to track users across sites, but may or
may not actually do so. In other words, the set of all do-
mains to which we observe a third-party request provides
an upper bound on the set of third-party trackers.

We tested TrackingExcavator’s detection and classi-
ﬁcation algorithms using a set of test websites that we
constructed and archived using the Wayback Machine,
triggering each of these tracking behaviors.
Reconstructing Archived Cookies. For many track-
ing types,
the presence or absence of cookies is a
key factor in determining whether the request rep-
resents a tracking behavior.
In our live measure-
ments, we have the actual Cookie headers attached by
Chrome during the crawl. On archived pages, the Way-
back Machine includes past Set-Cookie headers as
X-Archive-Orig-Set-Cookie headers on archived re-
sponses. To capture the cookies that would have actu-
ally been set during a live visit to that archived page,
TrackingExcavator must simulate a browser cookie store
based on these archival cookie headers and JavaScript
cookie set events recorded during data collection.

Unfortunately, cookie engines are complicated and
standards non-compliant in major browsers, including
Chrome [11]. Python’s cookie storage implementation
is compliant with RFC 2965, obsoleted by RFC 6265,
but these standards proposals do not accurately represent
modern browser practices [7, 13, 21]. For efﬁciency, we
nevertheless use Python’s cookie jar rather than attempt-
ing to re-implement Chrome’s cookie engine ourselves.
We found that Python’s cookie jar computed cook-
ies exactly matching Chrome’s for only 71% of requests
seen in a live run of the top 100. However, for most types
of tracking, we only need to know whether any cookies
would have been set for the request, which we correctly
determine 96% of the time. Thus our tool captures most
tracking despite using Python’s cookie jar.
Classifying Personal Trackers in Measurements. For
most tracker types, classiﬁcation is independent of user
behaviors. Personal trackers, however, are distinguished
from Vanilla trackers based on whether the user vis-
its that domain as a top-level page (e.g., Facebook or
Google). To identify likely Personal trackers in auto-
mated measurement, we thus develop a heuristic for user
browsing behaviors: we use popular sites from each year,
as these are (by deﬁnition) sites that many users visited.
Alexa’s top sites include several that users would not
typically visit directly, e.g., googleadservices.com.
Thus, we manually examined lists of popular sites for
each year to distinguish between domains that users typ-
ically visit intentionally (e.g., Facebook, Amazon) from
those which ordinary users never or rarely visit inten-
tionally (e.g., ad networks or CDNs). Two researchers

USENIX Association  

25th USENIX Security Symposium  1001

independently classiﬁed the domains on the Alexa top
100 sites for each year where we have Alexa data, gath-
ering information about sites for which they were unsure.
The researchers examined 435 total domains: for the top
100 domains in 2015, they agreed on 100% and identiﬁed
94 sites as potential Personal trackers; for the 335 addi-
tional domains in the previous years’ lists, they agreed
on 95.4% and identiﬁed 296 Personal tracker domains.
4 Evaluating the Wayback Machine as an
Archaeological Data Source for Tracking
The Wayback Machine provides a unique and compre-
hensive source of historical web data. However, it was
not created for the purpose of studying third-party web
tracking and is thus imperfect for that use. Nevertheless,
the only way to study web tracking prior to explicit mea-
surements targeting it is to leverage materials previously
archived for other purposes. Therefore, before using the
Wayback Machine’s archived data, it is essential to sys-
tematically characterize and analyze its capabilities and
ﬂaws in the context of third-party tracking.

In this section we thus study the extent to which data
from the Wayback Machine allows us to study histor-
ical web tracking behaviors. Beyond providing conﬁ-
dence in the trends of web tracking over time that we
present in Section 5, we view this evaluation of the Way-
back Machine as a contribution of this paper. While
others have studied the quality of the Wayback Ma-
chine’s archive, particularly with respect to the quality
of the archived content displayed on the top-level page
(e.g., [10, 38, 53]), we are the ﬁrst to systematically study
the quality of the Wayback Machine’s data about third-
party requests, the key component of web tracking.

To conduct our evaluation, we leverage four ground
truth data sets collected from the live web in 2011, 2013,
2015, and 2016. The 2011 data was originally used
in [60] and provided to us by those authors. All datasets
contain classiﬁcations of third-party cookie-based track-
ers (according to the above taxonomy) appearing on the
Alexa top 500 sites (from the time of each measurement).
The 2015 and 2016 data was collected by TrackingExca-
vator and further contains all HTTP requests, including
those not classiﬁed as tracking.3 We plan to release our
ground truth datasets from 2013, 2015, and 2016.

We organize this section around a set of lessons that
we draw from this evaluation. We apply these lessons in
our measurements in Section 5. We believe our ﬁndings
can assist future researchers seeking to use the Wayback
Machine as a resource for studying tracking (or other
web properties relying on third-party requests) over time.

3For comparison,

the published results based on the 2011
dataset [60] measured tracking on the homepages of the top 500 web-
sites as well as four additional pages on that domain; for the purposes
of our work, we re-analyzed the 2011 data using only homepages.

Table 1: Natural variability in the trackers observed on different
visits to the Alexa top 100 in 2015. This variability can result
from non-static webpage content, e.g., ad auctions that result in
different winners.

4.1 Lesson (Challenge): The Wayback Machine

provides a partial view of third-party requests

A key question for using the Wayback Machine for his-
torical measurements is: how complete is the archive’s
view of the past, both for the top-level pages and for
the embedded content? In this lesson, we explore why
its view is incomplete, surfacing challenges that we will
overcome in subsequent lessons. We identify several rea-
sons for the differences between the live and Wayback
measurements, and quantify the effects of each.
Variation Between Visits. Different trackers and other
third parties may appear on a site when it is loaded a
second time, even if these views are close together; an
example of this variation would be disparity in tracking
behaviors between ads in an ad network.

To estimate the degree of variation between page
views, we compare three live runs from August-
September 2015 of the Alexa top 100 sites (Table 1).
We ﬁnd that variation between runs even a week apart
is notable (though not enough to account for all of the
differences between Wayback and live datasets). For the
number of Vanilla trackers found, the August 25th and
September 1st runs vary by 7 trackers, or 6%.
Non-Archived and Blocked Requests. There are sev-
eral reasons that the Wayback Machine may fail to
archive a response to a request, or provide a response that
TrackingExcavator must ignore (e.g., from a far different
time than the one we requested or from the live web).
We describe these conditions here, and evaluate them in
the context of a Wayback Machine crawl of the top 500
pages archived in 2015, according to the 2015 Alexa top
500 rankings; we elaborate on this dataset in Section 5.
Table 2 summarizes how often the various conditions oc-
cur in this dataset, for requests, unique URLs, and unique
domains. In the case of domains, we count only those do-
mains for which all requests are affected, since those are
the cases where we will never see a cookie or any other
subsequent tracking indicators for that domain.
Robots.txt Exclusions (403 errors).
If a domain’s
robots.txt asks that it not be crawled, the Wayback
Machine will respect that restriction and thus not archive

Table 3: We compare the prevalence of the most common track-
ing types (Vanilla and Personal) over the four years for which
we have data from the live web. Though the Wayback Machine
provides only partial data on trackers, it nevertheless illumi-
nates a general upward trend reﬂected in our ground truth data.

missing cookie headers on otherwise archived responses.
For that, we must compare directly with live results.

We focus our attention on unique trackers: we attempt
to identify which live trackers are missing in the 2015
Wayback dataset, and why. For each tracker we ob-
serve in our 2015 live measurement, Figure 3 identiﬁes
whether we (1) also observe that tracker in “Wayback
mode,” (2) observe only a third-party request (but no con-
ﬁrmed cookie-based tracking behavior, i.e., we classify it
only as a third-party domain), or (3) do not observe any
requests to that tracker at all.

We conclude two things from this analysis. First, be-
cause the Wayback Machine may fail to provide suf-
ﬁcient data about responses or miss cookies even in
archived responses, many trackers conﬁrmed in the live
dataset appear as simple third-party requests in the Way-
back data (the second column in Figure 3). For example,
doubleclick.net, one of the most popular trackers,
appears as only a third party in Wayback data because of
its robots.txt ﬁle. Thus, we learn that to study third-
party web tracking in the past, due to missing data in the
archive, we must consider all third-party requests, not
only those conﬁrmed as trackers according to the taxon-
omy. Though considering only third-party requests will
overcount tracking in general (i.e., not all third parties on
the web are trackers), we ﬁnd that it broadens our view
of tracking behaviors in the archive.

Second, we ﬁnd that a non-trivial fraction of track-
ers are missing entirely from the archive (the third col-
umn in Figure 3). In the next subsection, we show that
we can nevertheless draw conclusions about trends over
time, despite the fact that the Wayback Machine under-
represents the raw number of third parties contacted.
4.3 Lesson (Opportunity): The Wayback Machine’s

data allows us to study trends over time

As revealed above, the Wayback Machine’s view of the
past may miss the presence of some third parties entirely.
Thus, one unfortunately cannot rely on the archive to
shed light on the exact raw numbers of trackers and other
third parties over time. Instead, we ask: does the Way-
back Machine’s data reveal genuine historical trends?

To investigate trends, we compare all of our live

datasets (2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016) to their Wayback
counterparts. Table 3 compares the number of Vanilla
and Personal trackers (the most prevalent types) detected
in each dataset. For the purposes of this comparison, we
sum the two types, since their distinction depends only
on the user’s browsing behaviors. We also include the
number of all third parties in the Wayback datasets, based
on the previous lesson. Though not all of these third par-
ties represent trackers in live data, they help illuminate
trends in third party prevalence over time.

We draw two conclusions from this comparison. First,
we ﬁnd that we can rely on the archive to illuminate gen-
eral trends over time. Although conﬁrmed trackers in
“Wayback mode” (as expected from our earlier lessons)
underrepresent the number of conﬁrmed trackers found
on the live web — and third parties in the archive overes-
timate conﬁrmed trackers in the live data — we ﬁnd that
the trends we see over time are comparable in both sets of
measurements. Critically, we see that the upward trend
in our archival view is not merely the result of improve-
ments in archive quality over time or other factors — we
indeed observe this trend reﬂected in ground truth data.
We gain further conﬁdence in these trends in Section 5,
where we see a rise in tracking behaviors since 1996 that
corresponds with our intuition. The absence of any large
vertical steps in the ﬁgures in Section 5 further suggests
that the trends we identify are artifacts of the web evolv-
ing as opposed to any signiﬁcant changes in the Wayback
Machine archival process.

Second, however, we ﬁnd that — although long-term
trends appear to be meaningfully represented by the
Wayback Machine — one should not place too much
conﬁdence into small variations in trends. For exam-
ple, the Wayback Machine’s data in 2013 appears to be
worse than in other years, under-representing the num-
ber of conﬁrmed trackers more than average. Thus, in
Section 5, we do not report on results that rely on small
variations in trends unless we have other reasons to be-
lieve that these variations are meaningful.

4.4 Lesson (Opportunity): Popular trackers are

represented in the Wayback Machine’s data

Because popular trackers, by deﬁnition, appear on many
sites that users likely browse to, they have a strong effect
on user privacy and are particularly important to exam-
ine. We ﬁnd that although the Wayback Machine misses
some trackers (for reasons discussed above), it does cap-
ture a large fraction of the most popular trackers —
likely because the Wayback Machine is more likely to
have correctly archived at least one of each popular
tracker’s many appearances.

Speciﬁcally, when we examine the 2015 archival and
live datasets, we ﬁnd that 100% of the top 20 trackers
from the live dataset are represented as either conﬁrmed

Fig-
ure 4 shows the total number of unique trackers observed
over time (the grey bars) and the prevalence of different
tracking behavior types (the lines) for the top 500 sites
from 1996-2016. Note that trackers may exhibit more
than one behavior across sites or on a single site, so the
sum of the lines may be greater than the height of the bar.
We note that the particularly large bars in 2015 and 2016
may reﬂect not only a change in tracking prevalence but
also changes in the way the Wayback Machine archived
the web. See Table 3 for validation against live data
which suggest that actual growth may have been smaller
and more linear, similar to past years.

tracker to appear in our dataset

We make several observations. First, we see the emer-
gence of different tracking behaviors:
the ﬁrst cookie-
based tracker in our data is from 1996: microsoft.com
as a Vanilla tracker on digital.net. The ﬁrst Per-
sonal
is in 1999:
go.com shows up on 5 different sites that year, all
also owned by Disney:
disney.com, espn.com,
sportszone.com, wbs.net, and infoseek.com (ac-
quired by Disney mid-1999 [1], before the date of our
measurement). The existence of a Personal tracker that
only appeared on sites owned by the same company dif-
fers from today’s Personal tracking ecosystem, in which
social media widgets like the Facebook “Like” button ap-
pear on many popular sites unafﬁliated with that tracker
(Facebook, in this case) [60].

More generally, we see a marked increase in quanti-
ties of trackers over time, with rises in all types of track-
ing behavior. One exception is Forced trackers — those
relying on popups — which are rare and peaked in the
early 2000s before popup blockers became default (e.g.,
in 2004 for Internet Explorer [54]). Indeed, we see third-
party popups peak signiﬁcantly in 2003 and 2004 (17 and
30 popups, respectively, compared to an annual mean of
about 4), though we could not conﬁrm all as trackers for
Figure 4. Additionally, we see an increasing variety of
tracking behavior over time, with early trackers nearly
all simply Vanilla, but more recent rises in Personal, An-
alytics, and Referred tracking.

We can also consider the complexity of individual
trackers, i.e., how many distinct tracking behaviors they
exhibit over each year’s dataset. (Note that some behav-
iors are exclusive, e.g., a tracker cannot be both Personal
and Vanilla, but others are nonexclusive.) Table 4 sug-
gests that there has been some increase in complexity in
recent years, with more trackers exhibiting two or even
three behaviors. Much of this increase is due to the rise
in Referred or Referred Analytics trackers, which receive
cookie values shared explicitly by other trackers in addi-
tion to using their own cookies in Vanilla behavior.

of Javascript APIs which can be used to ﬁngerprint

browsers and persist identiﬁers even across cookie dele-
tion. Though the use of these APIs does not necessarily
imply that they are used for tracking (and we know of no
published heuristic for correlating API use with genuine
ﬁngerprinting behaviors), the use of these APIs neverthe-
less allows third parties to gather potentially rich infor-
mation about users and their machines. The full list of
37 ﬁngerprint-related APIs we measure (based on prior
work [3, 4, 15, 56, 57]) is in Appendix A.

We now consider third parties that are proliﬁc users
of ﬁngerprint-related APIs, calling many APIs on each
site. Table 5 shows the tracker in each year that calls
the most APIs on a single site. Ties are broken by the
choosing the third party that appears on the largest num-
ber of sites. Maximum usage of APIs has increased over
time, but we observe that the most proliﬁc API users are
not the most popular cookie-based trackers. Although
we only identify API uses within JavaScript, and not
how their results are used, we note that increasing use

These
studies noted similar limitations as we did, as well as
ways it has changed over time [38]. Finally, researchers
have studied other aspects of the web and Internet lon-
gitudinally without the use of archives, including IPv6
adoption [12], search-engine poisoning [47], privacy no-
tices [52], and botnets [68].

7 Conclusion
Though third-party web tracking and its associated pri-
vacy concerns have received attention in recent years,
the practice long predates the ﬁrst academic measure-
ments studies of tracking (begun in 2005).
Indeed, in
our measurements we ﬁnd tracking behaviors as early as
1996. We introduce TrackingExcavator, a measurement
infrastructure for third-party web tracking behaviors that
leverages archive.org’s Wayback Machine to conduct
historical studies. We rigorously evaluate the Wayback
Machine’s view of past third-party requests and develop
strategies for overcoming its limitations.

We then use TrackingExcavator to conduct the most
extensive longitudinal study of the third-party web track-
ing ecosystem to date, retrospectively from 1996 to
present (2016). We ﬁnd that the web tracking ecosys-
tem has expanded in scope and complexity over time:
today’s users browsing the web’s popular sites encounter
more trackers, with more complex behaviors, with wider
coverage, and with more connections to other trackers,
than at any point in the past 20 years. We argue that
understanding the trends in the web tracking ecosystem
over time — provided for the ﬁrst time at this scale by
our work — is important to future discussions surround-
ing web tracking, both technical and political.

Beyond web tracking, there are many questions about
the history and evolution of the web. We believe our
evaluation of the Wayback Machine’s view of the past,
as well as TrackingExcavator, which we plan to release
with this paper, will aid future study of these questions.

A Fingerprint-Related JavaScript APIs
As described in Section 3, TrackingExcavator hooks
a number of JavaScript APIs that may be used in
ﬁngerprint-based tracking and drawn from prior work [3,
4, 15, 56, 57]. The complete list:

• navigator.appCodeName
• navigator.appName
• navigator.appVersion

• navigator.cookieEnabled
• navigator.doNotTrack
• navigator.language
• navigator.languages
• navigator.maxTouchPoints
• navigator.mediaDevices
• navigator.mimeTypes
• navigator.platform
• navigator.plugins
• navigator.product
• navigator.productSub
• navigator.userAgent
• navigator.vendor
• navigator.vendorSub
• screen.availHeight
• screen.availLeft
• screen.availTop
• screen.availWidth
• screen.colorDepth
• screen.height
• screen.orientation
• screen.pixelDepth
• screen.width
• CanvasRenderingContext2D.getImageData
• CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillText
• CanvasRenderingContext2D.strokeText
• WebGLRenderingContext.getImageData
• WebGLRenderingContext.fillText
• WebGLRenderingContext.strokeText
• HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL
• window.TouchEvent
• HTMLElement.offsetHeight
• HTMLElement.offsetWidth
• HTMLElement.getBoundingClientRect

B Ecosystem Complexity
Figure 12 (on the next page) visually depicts the connec-
tions between entities in the tracking ecosystem that we
observe in our datasets for 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012,
and 2016: domains as nodes, and referral relationships as
edges. Note that the visual organization of these graphs
(with nodes in multiple tiers) is not meaningful and sim-
ply an artifact of the graph visualization software. Over
time, the complexity and interconnectedness of relation-
ships between third-party domains on the top 450 web-
sites has increased dramatically.
