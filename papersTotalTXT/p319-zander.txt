ABSTRACT
The pool of unused routable IPv4 preﬁxes is dwindling, with less
than 4% remaining for allocation at the end of June 2014. Yet the
adoption of IPv6 remains slow. We demonstrate a new capture-
recapture technique for improved estimation of the size of “IPv4
reserves” (allocated yet unused IPv4 addresses or routable pre-
ﬁxes) from multiple incomplete data sources. A key contribution
of our approach is the plausible estimation of both observed and
unobserved-yet-active (ghost) IPv4 address space. This signiﬁ-
cantly improves our community’s understanding of IPv4 address
space exhaustion and likely pressure for IPv6 adoption. Using
“ping scans”, network traces and server logs we estimate that 6.3
million /24 subnets and 1.2 billion IPv4 addresses are currently in
use (roughly 60% and 45% of the publicly routed space respec-
tively). We also show how utilisation has changed over the last
2–3 years and provide an up-to-date estimate of potentially-usable
remaining IPv4 space.

INTRODUCTION

At the end of June 2014 less than 4% of the IPv4 address space
remained unallocated by Regional Internet Registrars (RIRs). RIPE
and APNIC have exhausted their supply and the other RIRs (except
AfriNIC) will run out of preﬁxes by the end of 2014 [1]. Under-
standing the pressures for IPv6 adoption, and the scope of possible

IPv4 address markets, requires plausible estimates of actual IPv4
address use – particularly the eﬃciency with which allocated pre-
ﬁxes are ﬁlled with actively-used addresses. Ideally, our estimation
techniques should also help the community track progressive ex-
haustion once all routable IPv4 preﬁxes are allocated.

Prior studies that, among other things, analysed IPv4 space
growth [2–4] and a port scan census from 2012 [5] used mainly
active probing (“pinging”). Yet pinging alone will under-count, as
many hosts do not respond or their responses are ﬁltered (e.g., by
ﬁrewalls). Recently, Dainotti et al. [6] used IPv4 data from multi-
ple sources to estimate the used /24 networks. Apart from a simple
multiplier in [3], previous work did not attempt to correct for under-
sampling.

Our key contribution in this work is a new method to estimate the
true population of both observed and unobserved (yet still active)
IPv4 addresses using a statistical capture-recapture (CR) [7–9]
model applied over diverse sources of active and passive measure-
ment data. We signiﬁcantly extend our earlier workshop paper,
with reﬁned methodology, additional data sources and greatly ex-
tended analysis [10].

Our second contribution is a three-year study of address use us-
ing our CR method. We “pinged” the allocated space with ICMP
echo requests and TCP port 80 probes, and also gathered IPv4
data from web server logs [11], email spam detector logs [12],
Wikipedia edit logs, logs of Valve’s Steam online game platform,
logs from Measurement Lab [13], and university access router’s
NetFlow logs.
Inevitably, our sources only detect actively used
addresses from 80% of the allocated space that is publicly routed
(based on [14]). Hence, our analysis is focused on the routed space.
Although our sources provide diverse evidence of active IPv4
address use, there are likely many in-use addresses that we never
see. We utilise our CR method to estimate a total population of
used IPv4 addresses (and /24 networks) that includes these unob-
served addresses (ghosts). As many sources obtain measurements
over weeks or months, our estimates of the used IPv4 addresses
(and /24 networks) are based on observation periods rather than
points in time. By cross-validation with our datasets, and compar-
ison with a few samples of ground truth, we show our CR method
provides better estimates than prior techniques. We analyse “de-
mand” – growth in address use – over the last 2–3 years relative
to factors such as the RIR, country, or preﬁx size, and estimate the
remaining “supply” of unused preﬁxes.

With just ICMP pinging we observed 4.9 million used /24 sub-
nets and 430 million used IP addresses. Our combined sources ob-
served 5.9 million used /24 subnets and 740 million used IPv4 ad-
dresses, yet our CR technique indicates signiﬁcantly higher actual
usage. We estimate 6.3 million /24 subnets and 1.2 billion IPv4 ad-
dresses were used by the end of June 2014 (approx. 60% and 45%

319of the publicly routed space respectively). From the end of 2011 to
June 2014, the growth in used /24 subnets and IPv4 addresses was
roughly linear, with an increase of 0.45 million /24 subnets and 170
million IPv4 addresses per year.

These trends mean routed but currently unused space could sup-
ply us until 2023. However, supply varies signiﬁcantly across re-
gions, for example Asia and South America only have supply for
another 2–4 years (without reallocations between RIRs). Moreover,
if, for example, only 75% of all routed /24 subnets could ever be
used, regions with tight supply, like Asia and South America, have
less than 1 year of supply left. Unrouted unused space may provide
more supply.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses related
work. Section 3 describes the concept of CR and our log-linear CR
models. Section 4 describes our IPv4 address data collection and
processing. Section 5 covers the validation of our CR model. In
Section 6 we analyse the growth of used IPv4 space over time, and
in Section 7 we estimate the space still unused. Section 8 concludes
and outlines future work.

2. RELATED WORK

The related measure of routed address space has been estimated
based on preﬁxes advertised by BGP [15,16]. However, estimation
of the number of actively used addresses began with Pryadkin et
al. [2], who used ICMP echo and TCP SYN probing to probe the
allocated Internet. They discovered 62 million used IPv4 addresses
in 2003 and 2004. Pryadkin et al. also showed that only a small
number of allocated preﬁxes appeared to be heavily used, while a
large part of the IPv4 space appeared unused or underutilized.

Heidemann et al. [3] infrequently probed all allocated IPv4 ad-
dresses (census) and frequently probed selected address samples
(survey) with ICMP echo pinging to study usage, availability and
up-time of addresses. The last census in 2007 from [3] accounted
for 112 million used addresses. Heidemann et al. compared ICMP
probing with TCP port 80 probing and passive measurements based
on small samples. They proposed a correction factor of 1.86, thus
estimating the total number of used IPv4 addresses in mid 2007
was 200–210 million.

Cai et al. [4] used ping survey data from [3] and conducted more
surveys in 2009–2010 to analyse typical address block sizes and
their characteristics. They did not directly estimate the used IPv4
address space, but observed: “most addresses in about one-ﬁfth of
/24 blocks are in use less than 10% of the time”.

From June to October 2012, anonymous researchers used hacked
commodity routers to perform a port scan of the IPv4 Internet [5].
They detected 420 million addresses that responded to ICMP echo,
which is broadly consistent with our two ping censuses that de-
tected 360 million addresses between March and September 2012.
In 2013 we initially proposed using a log-linear CR model to
estimate the true population of used IPv4 addresses from multiple
sources of IPv4 addresses [10]. Our preliminary workshop paper
found that our log-linear CR estimate is signiﬁcantly higher (one
billion used IPv4 addresses in mid 2013) than the aggregate number
of observed IPv4 addresses from multiple measurement sources.

Dainotti et al. [6] developed techniques to ﬁlter out spoofed IPv4
addresses from darknet or NetFlow data and showed that the ﬁl-
tered datasets can be used to estimate Internet address space usage.
With the ﬁltered darknet data, NetFlow data, and ping census data
from USC [3] combined, they estimated 4.8 million used /24 sub-
nets (47% of the routed space) in September 2012. This is broadly
consistent with the 5.2 million /24 subnets we observed in the year
to September 2012 (c.f. Figure 4). The diﬀerence is likely due to
the larger number of sources and the longer time window we use.

3. CAPTURE-RECAPTURE

There are many techniques for estimating population sizes from
limited samples. Some use problem-speciﬁc approaches, but many
use CR methods. CR methods have been used in ecology [7, 8],
epidemiology [9, 17], and to estimate missing links from observed
AS-graphs [18].

First, we discuss general assumptions for CR. Then, to illus-
trate CR, we discuss the simplest CR technique – the two-sample
Lincoln-Petersen (L-P) method. Since we have more than two
sources and for our data some assumptions of the L-P method are
violated, we do not use this method. Finally, we describe the log-
linear CR models that we use. Log-linear models make less restric-
tive assumptions and work with arbitrarily many sources.
3.1 General assumptions

A prime assumption of CR is that all individuals of the popu-
lation can be uniquely identiﬁed. This assumption obviously holds
for IPv4 addresses (we only care if an address was used but not who
used it). Another assumption is that the data sources only sample
“alive” individuals. We achieve that by ﬁltering out IPs from the
data sources that were sampled but not actually used, for example
due to address spooﬁng (see Section 4).

Any individuals with zero sample probability are not part of the
CR estimate. In our case these are all used IP addresses in publicly
unrouted space, which our sources cannot sample. Hence, our CR
estimates are only for the publicly routed space. Furthermore, there
may be some specialised devices using public IP addresses, such as
printers, that our current data sources also cannot sample. This
means our results likely have a downward “bias”, but as discussed
in Section 4.2 the error may be relatively small.
3.2 Two-sample Lincoln-Petersen method

The Lincoln-Petersen (L-P) method [7, 8] is ideal to illustrate
the basic principle behind CR, but has restrictive assumptions that
prevent us from using it.
3.2.1 Description
The two-sample L-P method works as follows. Given a ﬁrst sam-
ple, that observes M individuals, the size of the population would
be known if we knew what fraction of the population had been ob-
served. To estimate this, L-P takes a second sample. Say it contains
C individuals, of which R individuals occur in both samples. If the
fraction of “recaptured” individuals in the second sample equals
the fraction of the total population captured in the ﬁrst sample,
R/C = M/N, then the population N is [7, 8]:

N =

MC
R .

In our context, the samples or “sources” are diﬀerent active and
passive measurements (see Section 4). For concreteness, consider
Source 1 to result from pinging the entire IPv4 space and Source 2
to be all addresses in a server log. Based on the number of unique
addresses observed by Source 1 and Source 2, and the number of
unique addresses observed by both sources (Overlap) CR allows
to estimate the number of unobserved addresses (Unseen), as illus-
trated in Figure 1.
3.2.2 Assumptions
The L-P estimate assumes that the probability of an individual
being captured in one source does not depend on the probability of
being captured in a diﬀerent source (independent sources). It also
assumes that, within a sample, each individual has an equal chance
of being sampled (homogenous population). Furthermore, the L-P

estimate assumes that during measurement no individuals enter or
leave the population (closed population). However, a violation of
the last assumption is just another form of heterogeneity.

Given our data sources (see Section 4.1), there is no signiﬁcant
causal relationship to introduce source dependence. While some
samples are dependent, i.e. IPs observed in traﬃc ﬂows between
the two NetFlow-monitored sites or between one NetFlow site and
one of the logged sites (e.g. Wikipedia or the gaming site), their
number is very small compared to the overall size of the datasets
(less than 1%). However, the population is very heterogeneous; for
example, servers are more likely to respond to pinging, while client
machines may be more likely to appear in certain traﬃc logs.

Nevertheless, heterogeneity gives rise to what is called apparent
source dependence. For example, two sources that are biased to-
wards client machines will appear to be positively dependent given
another source that is less biased towards clients. In fact it is well
known that heterogeneity and source dependence are often con-
founded and cannot be clearly separated [19]. Apparent source de-
pendence must be treated similarly to source dependence.

If there is (apparent) dependence such that two sources are pos-
itively correlated, the L-P estimator underestimates the population
size: R/C > M/N and so N > MC/R. Similarly, if two sources are
negatively correlated, the L-P estimator overestimates the popula-
tion size. If the sign of the correlation is known, then L-P estimates
can be used to identify plausible lower or upper bounds [17].
3.3 Log-linear Models

Just as L-P uses a second sample to estimate the fraction of the
population of the ﬁrst sample, a third sample can be used to com-
pensate the correlation between the ﬁrst two samples. This is the
basic idea of log-linear models (LLMs) used for CR [17, 19, 20],
which can model (apparent) source dependence among arbitrarily
many sources.
3.3.1 Description
Let N be the unknown number of distinct individuals of the pop-
ulation. Let t denote the number of sources indexed by 1, 2, . . . , t.
For each individual, let s1 to st be deﬁned such that si = 1 if the
individual occurs in sample i and si = 0 otherwise. Then the string
s1s2 . . . st is called the “capture history” of the individual. The ob-
served outcome of all measurements can then be represented by
variables of the form zs, which are the numbers of individuals with
each capture history s = s1s2 . . . st. These are assumed to be in-
stances of random variables Zs. Note that individuals with the cap-
ture history 00 . . . 0 are unobserved, and our goal is to estimate
Z00...0. Table 1 illustrates the variables Zs for each possible cap-
ture history for three sources (t = 3); “yes” means an individual
was observed and “no” means an individual was not observed by a
source.
For each history s, let h(s) be the set of sources in which the
individual occurs; for example, h(101) = {1, 3}. Deﬁne the indi-
cator function 1A = 1 if statement A is true and 0 otherwise. We
can now write the following system of equations in 2t variables

u, u1, u2, . . . , u12, . . . , u23, . . . up to u12...t:

log(E (Zs)) =

uh =

uh1h⊆h(s) .

(cid:88)

For example, for t = 3, the system is

(cid:16)E(cid:16)

=u + u11i=1 + u21 j=1 + u31k=1
+ u121i=1∧ j=1 + u131i=1∧k=1
+ u231 j=1∧k=1 + u1231i=1∧ j=1∧k=1 .

The estimate of Z00...0 is then ˆZ00...0 = exp(u).

If we take
E[Zs] = zs then this system has 2t unknowns but only 2t − 1
equations, as Z00...0 is unknown. Hence it is customary to assume
u12...t = 0 [17]. As the number of sources t increases, this t-way
dependency becomes decreasingly important.

The model with all uh (the saturated model) is very sensitive to
small values of Zs. For example, a zero count for some capture
history may give ˆZ00...0 = 0, regardless of the other Zs [17]. Fur-
thermore, the larger t is, the higher is the random error for some
Zs. Including “noisy” parameters uh in a model results in a poor
predictive performance of the model (referred to as over-ﬁtting).

Over-ﬁtting is mitigated by “model selection” (see Section
3.3.2), in which some uh are forced to 0, to reﬂect assumed indepen-
dence between certain combinations of sources. For example, set-
ting u12 = 0 indicates sources 1 and 2 are independent. With such
incomplete models, the system of equations is overdetermined, and
the maximum likelihood parameters u are typically used, based on
the assumption that Zs result from uniform random sampling and
are hence Poisson distributed.

Assuming the Zs are Poisson distributed is appropriate if the up-
per limit for the Zs is unknown. However, we can bound Zs by
the size of the publicly routed IPv4 space. Hence, we use right-
truncated Poisson distributions deﬁned over [0, l] ∩ Z, where l is
the upper limit. These improve estimates substantially for small
strata, where the counters are relatively close to the limit (see Sec-
tion 5.2), but otherwise make little diﬀerence.
3.3.2 Model selection
Model selection for an LLM consists of selecting which uh will
be assumed a priori to be 0. The goal is to select the least complex
model with “adequate” ﬁt of the observed (and by assumption) un-
observed individuals [20].

A common approach is to minimize an “Information Criterion”

(IC). Two common ICs are [21]:

AIC = 2k − 2 log(L),

BIC = log(M)k − 2 log (L)

where L is the likelihood of the data given the assumed model, k
is the number of free parameters of the model and M is the num-
ber of observed individuals. AIC is used more often, but each has
merits [22]. Section 5 compares the BIC and the AIC for our data.
We choose the simplest model m such that no other model n has
ICn < ICm − 7 [21].

321In our case, k is the number of non-zero uh, but L is diﬃcult to
obtain. AIC and BIC assume that each source samples uniformly
and so L is the likelihood of a Poisson model. If the number of
samples is large, the central limit theorem indicates that substantial
deviations from the mean have very low likelihood. In our case,
as in [17, 19], the randomness comes largely from the choice of
sources to monitor, which is hard to characterise but has substan-
tially higher variance. Hence the Poisson assumption selects too
complex a model.

We mitigate this overﬁtting using the simple heuristic of dividing
all zs by some integer d when calculating L. It remains to select d.
If d is so large that any zs gets rounded to zero, the LLM breaks
down. The further heuristic of selecting d to be the largest number
less than mins zs appears to work well (see Section 5.1).
3.3.3 Estimate range
Besides computing point estimates, we also compute estimate
ranges (used in Section 5). We use the procedure in [23] to com-
pute a 100 (1 − α) % proﬁle likelihood “conﬁdence interval” (CI)
for ˆN. Note that this is not a true conﬁdence interval in our case,
since it is based on the assumption that each sample is drawn ran-
domly, resulting in a Poisson number of samples with each history.
In contrast, our samples arise from diﬀerent, not completely ran-
dom sampling procedures. Hence we treat these “conﬁdence in-
tervals” as merely a useful heuristic indication of the sensitivity to
modelling variations and we set α = 10−7 to obtain wide CIs.
3.3.4 Sampling zeros
Even with appropriate model selection, if the number of samples
across all sources is low, we may have a large number of zs that
are near zero leading to unreliable estimates. In our case this only
occurs for a few small countries or territories when stratifying by
country code (see Section 3.4). Hence, we exclude country codes
with fewer than 1000 IP addresses observed by all sources from the
results in Section 6.2 (where they are negligible) and in Section 6.7.
3.4 Stratiﬁcation

We obtain more insight and also initially hoped to mitigate het-
erogeneity by stratifying the population in diﬀerent ways. We clas-
siﬁed IPv4 addresses as statically or dynamically assigned using the
approach described in [10], and based on allocation and whois data
we stratiﬁed by RIR (e.g. APNIC), country, preﬁx size, industry1
and allocation age.

4. DATASETS AND PREPROCESSING

An IPv4 address is considered used if it responds to active probes
or participates in connections. A used /24 subset contains one or
more used addresses. This section describes our sources of used
IPv4 address data, our data collection and processing, and our han-
dling of both spoofed and dynamically assigned addresses.
4.1 Datasets

Our ﬁrst two datasets are from actively probing the whole al-
located IPv4 Internet using ICMP echo requests (IPING) and TCP
SYN packets to port 802 (TPING). Since mid-2011 we probed each
allocated IPv4 address (a census) once every 6 months. The ﬁrst
two censuses used ICMP probing and the rest used both ICMP and
TCP probing (with TCP probing seeing over 7% more observed

government, corporate, or ISP. We classiﬁed 88% of the allocated
address space based on whois information (down to /17 networks).

monly used TCP ports and found port 80 to be the most responsive.

IP addresses). We limited the overall ping rate and used reversed
bit counting for “traversing” the IP space. On average our prober
sent only one packet every two hours to individual /24 networks,
to minimise congestion, stay below typical ICMP or TCP rate limit
thresholds and avoid triggering monitoring systems (on average we
received only 10–20 complaints per census). For the ﬁrst half of
2011 we use ICMP ping data collected by USC/LANDER [24].

We utilise data gathered from 2011 onwards. We generate
datasets of unique /24 subnets by processing the IPv4 datasets and
setting the last octet of each address to zero and then ﬁltering out
the duplicates. Table 2 shows the number of unique IPv4 addresses
and /24 subnets per dataset for the years 2011–2013 (IPs for GAME
omitted for conﬁdentiality). Note that the numbers in the table can-
not be used as growth trends due to sample method variations.
4.2 Host types sampled

We collected data from diverse locations, but CR estimates will
only be useful if (1) our datasets sample all types of devices using
public IPv4 addresses and (2) a type of device can be sampled by
multiple datasets. We now discuss whether this is the case based
on grouping devices into routers, servers/proxies, clients (e.g. PCs,
smart phones), and specialised devices (e.g. printers, cameras).

ISP routers are sampled by IPING and TPING and may also ap-
pear in SWIN and CALT. Home routers are sampled by IPING and
TPING (we conﬁrmed that some responses came from Cable/DSL
routers by inspecting web pages from IPs responding to TPING)
and by all other sources (with NAT packets sent from home net-
works appear to come from home routers). Servers/proxies are
sampled by IPING, TPING, SWIN and CALT. They can also ap-
pear in WIKI, SPAM and WEB. Clients are sampled mainly by
WIKI, SPAM, MLAB, WEB, GAME, SWIN and CALT, but also
appear in IPING. NAT’ed clients also appear in IPING and TPING.
Specialised devices may be sampled by IPING and TPING.

Overall, our datasets sample most groups well, especially servers
and clients, which we assume are the largest groups. Specialised
devices are likely severely under-represented, but these are very
hard to sample. The authors of [5] probed the entire IPv4 Inter-
net on several hundred ports and detected 36 million addresses that
only responded to TCP SYNs but not to ICMP. In our censuses
15–20 million IPs reacted to port 80 TCP SYNs but not to ICMP.
The diﬀerence of 15–20 million addresses could be specialised de-
vices listening only on speciﬁc ports5 we missed, but this number is
small compared to our total estimate of 1.2 billion used addresses.
4.3 Time windows

We collected data from 1 Jan 2011 until 30 June 2014. To anal-
yse the growth trend of used IPv4 addresses, we split our data
into overlapping 12-month windows. Windows start every three
months, so the ﬁrst window starts at 1 Jan 2011 and the last window
starts at 1 Jul 2013. The last window ends at 30 June 2014. This is a
suitable trade-oﬀ between temporal resolution and noisy estimates.

Also, for some datasets we cannot have smaller gaps between win-
dows, e.g. we only conducted IPING/TPING censuses every six
months and we only collected GAME data every 3+ months.

Overlapping windows smooth out quick changes, but we believe
fast transients in the number of used IPv4 addresses are unlikely.
In the rest of the paper we associate statistics with the end of time
windows. For example, for the ﬁrst window the observed and esti-
mated used space is associated with 31 December, 2011.
4.4 Data collection and processing

Our goal is to get datasets of publicly routed IPv4 addresses that
were actually used. We do not distinguish whether IPs were used
legitimately or illegitimately, such as addresses hijacked by spam-
mers. For active probing we assume that positive responses only
occur when IP addresses were used – the same assumption made
by previous work [2–4].

For IPING we only counted IPv4 addresses that returned ICMP
echo replies, “destination protocol unreachable” or “destination
port unreachable” messages. We ignored addresses with other
ICMP errors or “TTL exceeded” messages, as for these it is un-
clear if they were actually used. For TPING we only counted
addresses that returned SYN/ACKs. We ignored addresses that
returned RSTs, as 25% of RSTs cover nearly contiguous /25 or
larger networks, suggesting they may have originated from ﬁre-
walls. Lack of reply indicates an address was truly unused, a host
ignored the probe, or the probe or response was ﬁltered or lost.

For the passive datasets we extracted the IPv4 addresses from
log ﬁles. We ﬁltered out multicast and private addresses (e.g.,
10.0.0.0/8), and those in unallocated or unrouted space. We identi-
ﬁed the routed space based on the route-views dataset from Route-
Views (RVs) [14]. For each time window we downloaded weekly
snapshots from RV and then aggregated all the snapshots (exclud-
ing a few unallocated but advertised preﬁxes).

For WIKI, SPAM, MLAB, WEB and GAME (server logs), the
addresses are only recorded for successful TCP sessions, so we can
be sure the addresses were used. SWIN and CALT contain unused
IPs from inside the two networks due to scanning that we cannot
ﬁlter out, but their number is negligible compared to the sizes of
the datasets. More problematically is that SWIN and CALT also
contain spoofed IPv4 addresses from outside the two networks that
do not represent used addresses. We describe our ﬁltering of these
in the following section.
4.5 Removal of spoofed IPs

We only have lists of observed IP addresses for SWIN and CALT.
We do not have packet or ﬂow data, and we do not know from

which IPs ﬂows originated. Hence, instead of using the technique
in [6], we needed a new heuristic to remove spoofed addresses.

Our heuristic is based on the assumption that spoofed IP ad-
dresses, which were not actively used, are uniformly distributed
over the IP space, since there are two main reasons for these:

• Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks where the at-
tacking machines send traﬃc from spoofed source addresses
selected randomly [25].

• Port scans where the scanner uses decoys. For example, the
prominent nmap scanning tool has an option that allows cre-
ating additional scans from random spoofed addresses to ob-
fuscate the identity of the scanning host(s).

Note that for CR spoofed addresses only cause errors if they were
not actually used. DDoS attacks where the attacker spoofs the
source address to be the victim’s address (reﬂector attacks) are
not a problem, as for these the spoofed addresses are most likely
used. Also note that while the autonomous systems (ASs) ﬁlter-
ing spoofed source addresses may not be uniformly distributed,
this does not aﬀect the overall uniform distribution, since attack-
ers or scanners (or their machines) are usually distributed across
the whole Internet including ASs that do not ﬁlter.

The assumption of uniform distribution is supported by circum-
stantial evidence from our data. We observed that the unﬁltered
SWIN and CALT have uniformly random distributed IPv4 ad-
dresses in six /8 preﬁxes that were completely or almost completely
unused by other sources (e.g. 53.0.0.0/8 or 55.0.0.0/8).6 While the
number of observed IPs from these ‘empty’ /8 subnets diﬀers for
SWIN and CALT, for a given dataset and time period the number of
observed IPs is roughly identical for these /8 – consistent with the
assumption that spoofed addresses are uniformly distributed over
the IPv4 space.

Our approach works in two stages. First, we estimate which /24
subnets should be removed entirely, and then we remove potentially
spoof addresses from used /24s.

From SWIN and CALT we removed all /24 subnets that:

1. have fewer than m observed IPs, and

2. have no overlapping IPs that are also in the spoof-free WIKI,

WEB, MLAB and GAME datasets.

6The number of addresses from these /8 in our non-spoofed sources
is negligible (no more than a few tens of addresses) and in some
cases we know from the network administrators that these /8 are
hardly used. However, for SWIN and CALT we see more than
10,000 addresses in these /8.

323We choose m as follows. Treating spoofed IPs as uniformly sam-
pled from a space of s IPs with probability p, the number X of
spoofed IPs in the space follows a Binomial distribution. Speciﬁ-
cally:

Pr (X > k) = 1 − k(cid:88)

(cid:19)

(cid:18) n

i

i

pi (1 − p)n−i .

In our case of /24 subnets, s = 256 and we estimate p based
on the number of spoofed IPs S in each ‘empty’ /8 preﬁx, so
p = S /224. We then choose m = k where Pr (X > k) < 10−8.
Note that for SWIN, S is relatively constant across all time periods
(10,000–15,000), but for CALT it increases from 15,000–20,000
until December 2013 to almost 250,000 in March 2014.

Spoofed IP addresses will also fall into /24 subnets that have
actually used IP addresses. The second phase is to ﬁlter out po-
tentially spoofed IPs in used /24 as follows. Since we assume
the spoofed IPs to be uniformly random distributed, the number
of spoofed IPs is S for used /8 preﬁxes as well. Subtracting the
number of already removed IPs in spoofed /24 subnets we have S (cid:48)
i
spoofed IPs left in /8 preﬁx i. Given the observed number of IPs Ti
in /8 preﬁx i in SWIN or CALT the expected number of not-spoofed
addresses per /8 preﬁx (out of 224 addresses) is

On average the probability that an IP in i is valid (V) is

Pr (V) =

This tells us how many IPs to keep in each /8 preﬁx, but we
must also determine which IPs to keep. To do this we use the
fact that the distribution of the ﬁnal byte B of used addresses is
not uniform. We estimate the probability P(B|V) from the IPs ob-
served by all sources except SWIN and CALT. Then assuming that
P(B|not V) = 1
256 (uniform distribution), Bayes’ rule gives that an
IP is not spoofed in SWIN or CALT with probability

Pr (V|B) =

Pr (V) Pr (B|V)

Pr (V) Pr (B|V) + (1 − Pr (V)) /256 .

We then ﬁlter SWIN and CALT by independently removing ad-

dresses ending with B with probability 1 − P(V|B).

We cannot evaluate the true accuracy of our approach, but the
following circumstantial evidence shows that it is eﬀective. With
ﬁltering, randomly distributed IPs in the ‘empty’ /8 networks are
removed. With ﬁltering, the number of used /24 subnets gradually
increases over time and does not show large abrupt increases and
decreases anymore. Without ﬁltering the number of /24 subnets in
SWIN or CALT is much higher than in any other dataset, e.g.
it
is up to 30% higher than for our largest dataset (IPING) and up to
60% higher compared to WEB, GAME. After ﬁltering the number
of used /24 subnets in SWIN and CALT is lower or similar to that
in WEB and GAME.

Figure 2 shows the beneﬁt of ﬁltering spoofed addresses. LLM
estimates that include ﬁltered SWIN and CALT are quite consis-
tent with LLM estimates made without SWIN and CALT. LLM
estimates using unﬁltered SWIN and CALT are much higher (ex-
ceeding the possible maximum for March 2014). To save space,
we only show this comparison for /24 subnets, as spoofed IPs have
less negative impact on the number of observed and estimated used
IPv4 addresses due to the uniform random nature and low (10% or
less) estimated percentage of spoofed IPs.

without spoof ﬁltering compared to observed and estimated /24
subnets without SWIN and CALT

4.6 Dynamic and static addresses

Many IPv4 addresses are (re)assigned dynamically (such as with
DHCP or PPPoE). Hence, long passive measurements may observe
multiple addresses for a single host, and over-count the number of
simultaneously used addresses.

If each assignment uses the lowest/highest unused address of
a pool, then the total number of addresses used from the pool is
the maximum simultaneous pool utilisation and the LLM estimate
would indeed estimate the maximum number of simultaneously
used addresses. However, if addresses are drawn uniformly, as our
measurements suggest, then all pool addresses could be observed
even if at most one address is in use at a time. Similarly, a single
host moving between multiple statically assigned addresses may
report multiple addresses, even if at most one is in use at a time.

However, addresses assigned to pools cannot be used elsewhere.
So we argue that any over-count captures addresses (or /24 subnets)
that are on “stand-by” and de facto ‘in use’ at the time of our mea-
surement. (In the future under-utilised pools may be reduced in size
and the freed addresses may be used for other purposes. However,
this is the same as re-purposing addresses of de facto unused hosts.
We cannot quantify such future optimisations.)

We also study /24 subnets, which are less aﬀected by dynamic
addressing [6]. While address reassignments (e.g., host mobility)
may cross diﬀerent /24 subnets, a large fraction of them will be
within the same /24 subnets. Evidence for this we found in 16
consecutive days of GAME session data, where we have unique
client IDs, client login/logout times and client IP addresses. We se-
lected 9 million distinct clients with multiple sessions and analysed
the number of distinct IPv4 addresses and /24 networks used over
time. After the ﬁrst four days all clients had logged in at least once.
From this point in time the observed distinct IP addresses increased
2.7 times (from 16 to 42 million), while the observed distinct /24
networks only increased 1.2 times (from 2.3 to 2.8 million).

5. VALIDATION

In this section, we ﬁrst pick a speciﬁc model-selection algorithm
from among those described in Section 3.3.2, based on test data.
Then, we compare estimated use of addresses against ground truth
for a handful of networks, and show that CR gives better estimates
than simply summing the observed addresses. Finally, we use
cross-validation to demonstrate that this also applies to the whole
address space, since we have no ground truth for most networks.

To perform cross-validation with our k = 9 data sources we con-
sider a particular source i as the “universe” of possible IPv4 ad-
dresses. We apply CR to the addresses/subnets in i that are also in
the other k−1 sources, to estimate the number of individuals unique
to source i. Since we know the true number of individuals unique
to i, we can evaluate the eﬀectiveness of CR. We do this for each
source, to obtain the mean error and mean-square error. We then
assume that the CR estimator based on the full k sets is equally ac-
curate at estimating the true number of ghosts, although we do not
have conﬁdence intervals for this.
5.1 Model selection

We ﬁrst investigated how to best select models, as our model se-
lection approach in Section 3.3.2 leaves us with the choice of two
ICs and the choice of how to dimension the count pre-processing
heuristic. In initial experiments we varied the IC used (AIC, BIC)
and we varied d for the count pre-processing heuristic. The vari-
able d was either adaptive (starting with d = 1000 in each step we
halved d, selecting the ﬁrst d smaller than mins zs) or ﬁxed to values
of 1, 10, 100, or 1000.

For each parameter setting we performed cross-validation for
each time window, except the ﬁrst window for which we have the
least data, for both used IPv4 addresses and used /24 subnets. Ta-
ble 3 shows the diﬀerent parameter settings we investigated and the
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
averaged over all sources and time windows.

With a ﬁxed divisor using the actual counters (ﬁxed1) results in
the highest errors for IPs but provides low errors for /24 subnets.
We think this is because (1) there is much more noise in the ob-
served IPs than in the observed /24 subnets and (2) the number of
observed /24 subnets is much lower than the number of IPs, and
hence even for a small divisor of 10 we already start losing in-
formation for /24 subnets, which leads to much reduced accuracy.
Choosing a divisor around 100 results in the smallest error for IPs
but the largest error for /24 subnets. Eﬀectively, the choice depends
on the type of data and it is unclear what choice would be the best
for estimating the IP addresses and /24 subnets unseen overall.

In contrast, our adaptive approach (with a maximum divisor of
1000) works quite well for both IPs and /24 subnets, with errors not
much larger than the minimum errors. With the adaptive approach,
using the BIC instead of the AIC lowers the error for IPs and in-
creases the error for /24 subnets, but the increase for /24 subnets is
small and even for /24 subnets the estimates obtained with the BIC
are smoother.7 Hence, in the rest of the paper the estimates pre-
7The BIC selects fewer parameters representing interactions of
many sources, which have a much lower number of samples than
interactions between fewer sources and hence are noisier.

sented are based on our adaptive approach with a maximum divisor
of 1000 and we use the BIC.
5.2 Comparison with ground truth

We compared our observed and estimated IP addresses with the
ground truth for several networks. Our ground truth is estimates
of the number of actively used IPv4 addresses at peak times (eﬀec-
tively high watermarks). Since our time windows are very long (12
months), it is appropriate to compare our estimates with high wa-
termarks. We compare the ground truth with the observed and es-
timated numbers for the time windows where the high watermarks
occurred roughly in the middle of the windows.

For privacy reasons we cannot reveal the identity of the net-
works. We also cannot reveal their sizes, as this would leak in-
formation, which allows narrowing down the possible identities (to
a very small set in the case of one particular network). The largest
network covered is two /16 subnets and the smallest network is
roughly one /20 combined from multiple allocations.

For each network Table 4 shows the number of addresses that re-
sponded to ping, the number of addresses observed, the number of
addresses estimated (for both Poisson and right-truncated Poisson),
and the actual number of used addresses as percentages of the sizes
of the routed networks. Note that network F blocked our pinger, so
we do not have IPING or TPING data for this network.

The results show that the percentage of pingable and observed
addresses is much smaller than the ground truth for networks A, C,
D, E and F, whereas for the more “open” network B the percentage
of observed addresses is relatively close to the truth. However, the
CR estimates are always much closer to the truth. Using right-
truncated Poisson distributions gives better estimates than using
Poisson distributions. The right-truncated Poisson estimates tend
to be higher than the truth (except for network F where we do not
have IPING and TPING), but the cause may be dynamic addresses
(e.g. DHCP) leading to higher estimates due to our long 12-month
observation windows in contrast to the short-term peak numbers we
use as truth.
5.3 Cross-validation results illustrated

Figure 3 illustrates the results of the cross-validation for ad-
dresses and subnets for time window 9 (results for other time win-
dows are largely consistent). The ﬁgure shows the number of IPs in
each source also observed by IPING (Obs ping), the total number
of addresses of a source also observed by any other sources (Obs.
all), and the ranges of the CR estimates (conﬁdence interval based
on proﬁle likelihood with α = 10−7 to get wide intervals). Since
the sources are of diﬀerent sizes we normalised the number of ad-
dresses on the total number of addresses observed by each source

RV [14]. For each time window we downloaded and ag-
gregated weekly snapshots (excluding unallocated but adver-
tised preﬁxes). Gregori et al. [26] suggests that while RV
data is incomplete for AS-level graph analysis, it does cap-
ture the whole routed space.

• Observed IPv4 addresses and /24 subnets:

the ad-
dresses/networks present in one or several of the data sources
described in Section 4.1.

• Estimated IPv4 addresses and /24 subnets: the total number
of addresses/networks estimated with CR, which means the
observed addresses/networks plus the unseen estimated ad-
dresses/networks. For clarity in the ﬁgures we plot the point
estimates instead of the estimated ranges.

Figure 3: IP addresses observed with ping, observed by any source,
and estimated ranges for LLM normalised on the true number of
unseen IPs for each data source

In the ﬁgures with normalised data, we always normalise each se-
ries on the ﬁrst value – the ﬁrst time window (31 December 2011).
6.2 Used IPv4 space totals

(the ground truth). A CR estimate is good, if the normalised range
includes 1 and the range is not too large.

Figure 3 shows that for IPv4 addresses all sources other than
IPING and GAME have relatively high overlap, but between 10%
and 15% of addresses appear only in one source. Only 50–60%
of addresses of each source (except TPING) is in IPING, showing
that ICMP pinging undercounts signiﬁcantly. The CR estimates for
WIKI, WEB, IPING, MLAB, SPAM, and SWIN are quite good.
The estimated ranges for TPING and CALT are slightly too low,
and the estimated range for GAME is slightly too high. Neverthe-
less, the LLM CR estimates are a substantial improvement over just
using the number of observed IPs.

For brevity we do not show the ﬁgure for /24 subnets. For /24
subnets there is a very high overlap between all data sources. How-
ever, for most sources only 90% or less of the /24 subnets appear in
IPING, so just using ICMP pinging signiﬁcantly undercounts even
the used /24 subnets. While the diﬀerence between CR estimates
and observed addresses is much smaller for /24 subnets (in most
cases the diﬀerence is only 1–2%, except for IPING), our CR esti-
mates are still an improvement.

Table 5 shows the estimated used IPv4 addresses and /24 subnets
depending on diﬀerent stratiﬁcations (RIR, country, preﬁx size, in-
dustry, allocation age) as introduced in Section 3.4, as well as the
pingable, observed and estimated unseen addresses and /24 subnets
at the end of June 2014. For each type of stratiﬁcation we separated
each source into the diﬀerent strata, then used CR to estimate the
size of each strata, and ﬁnally we summed up the estimates over all
strata to get the total estimate.

Only 430 million IPs and 4.9 million /24s responded to ICMP
ping, but we observed 740 million IPs and 5.9 million /24s from
all sources combined. The estimated used IPs are fairly consistent
across stratiﬁcations: roughly 1.1–1.2 billion used IPv4 addresses
and 6.2–6.3 million used /24 subnets. Based on RV this means we
observed only 27% of the routed IPv4 addresses and 55% of the
routed /24 subnets, but we estimate that roughly 45% of the routed
IPv4 addresses and 60% of the routed /24 subnets were used.

For all stratiﬁcations our estimates are always plausible (below
the number of routed addresses). The quotient of estimated used
addresses divided by the addresses detected only with ICMP echo
pinging is 2.6–2.7, larger than the correction factor of 1.86 in [3].
6.3 Used IPv4 space over time

6. USED SPACE ANALYSIS

Now, we present the results for the estimated used IPv4 ad-
dresses and /24 subnets. We present both total estimates as well as
estimates for diﬀerent RIRs, countries, allocation ages, and alloca-
tion preﬁx sizes. We also investigate growth on a longer time scale
and whether our estimates are sensible given the reported growth
of Internet users.
6.1 Deﬁnitions

In most ﬁgures we plot one or more of the following metrics:
• Routed IPv4 addresses and /24 networks: the total number
of addresses/networks that were publicly routed based on

Figure 4 shows the number of estimated used /24 subnets against
the number of observed and routed /24 subnets both as absolute
numbers and normalised. The dashed line is the actual estimates
and the solid line is the estimates smoothed. The total number of
observed /24 increased from 4.8 million to 5.9 million, but we es-
timate that the number of /24 subnets actually increased from 5.1
million to over 6.2 million (an increase of 0.45 million subnets per
year). The estimate range is narrow, the minimum and maximum
are within ±1% of the point estimates. Whilst the routed space
only increased by 7% in two years, the number of observed and
estimated used /24 subnets increased by 22% over the same time.

absolute numbers and normalised. The number of observed IPv4
addresses increased from 450 million to 740 million, but we esti-
mate that the number of addresses actually increased from 720 mil-
lion to 1.2 billion (an average increase of about 170 million IPv4
addresses per year). Minimum and maximum of the estimate range
are within ±3% of the point estimate. As for /24 subnets, the ob-
served and estimated number of IPv4 addresses increased faster
than the routed addresses. The diﬀerence between estimated and
observed relative growth may be in part because of earlier under-
counting due to fewer sources and a gap in the GAME data collec-
tion.

The number of estimated /24 networks is only 5–10% above the
number of observed /24 networks, whereas the number of estimated
IPs is 50–60% above the number of observed IPs. Intuitively this
makes sense, since a /24 network is observed if any of its addresses
if observed. The relatively small error for /24s means one could
treat the number of observed /24s as relatively good approximation
of the number of actually used /24s.
6.4 Used IPv4 space by RIR

Figure 6 shows the estimated number of IPv4 addresses over
time depending on the RIR responsible for their allocation both
as absolute numbers and normalised. For brevity we omitted the
broadly similar statistics for /24 subnets. APNIC has the largest
number of used addresses followed by RIPE and ARIN. Looking
at relative growth, AfriNIC is growing at the fastest rate, followed

by LACNIC. Of the three RIRs with the most allocated space, rel-
atively APNIC and ARIN are growing faster than RIPE.
6.5 Used IPv4 space by preﬁx size

Figure 7 shows the average yearly growth rate for addresses for
diﬀerent preﬁx sizes (based on the RIR allocation data). For brevity
we do not show the estimates for /24 networks here, as the trends
are broadly similar. Absolute growth is strongest in the large pre-
ﬁxes /10 to /16 (/8 and /9 have not grown much). However, if
we look at relative growth, growth has been more equally across
many preﬁxes. Exceptions are the old /8 allocations which have
not grown and /9, /21 and /22 allocations which show the strongest
growth (/9 is driven up by a few ISPs since there are less than ten
/9 allocations overall, and /22 is the largest allocation handed out
by APNIC since 15 April, 2011, and by RIPE since 14 Sep, 2012).
6.6 Used IPv4 space by allocation age

Figure 8 shows the average yearly growth rate of IPv4 addresses
for diﬀerent allocation ages (based on RIR allocation data) until the
end of 2013. For brevity we omitted the results for /24 subnets as
the trend is broadly similar. In absolute numbers the more recent
allocations made since 2005 are growing the most, with a clear pos-
itive correlation between recentness and growth. In relative terms
growth is strongest for allocations made in the last three years, but
we can also see 20% or higher growth in some old allocations.

Figure 9 shows the absolute and relative growth for IPv4 ad-
dresses for the countries with the largest number of observed used
IPv4 addresses (at least 1.5 million addresses). Again, we do not
show results for /24 subnets as the trends are broadly similar. Ab-
solute growth is strongest in the two nations with the largest allo-
cations (USA, China) followed by Brazil and South Korea. Rela-
tive growth is between 10% and 30% for many countries, but Ro-
mania and several Asian and South American countries (Brazil,
Columbia, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Argentina, Thailand, Tai-
wan, and China) have grown faster.
6.8 Long-term growth

Figure 10 shows the number of allocated addresses since 2003
(from RIR data), routed and allocated addresses since 2008 (from
RV) and the number of pingable, observed and estimated addresses
over time for our 12-month time windows. The ping data from
2003 to 2011 is from USC/LANDER [3]. The ping data since 2012
is the 12-months windows of IPING. Note that allocated and routed
addresses are plotted on a diﬀerent scale (right y-axis).

Two distinct phases are visible for the number of allocated ad-
dresses: the last boom 2004–2011, and the slowdown due to run-
ning out of unallocated addresses since 2011. The number of allo-
cated addresses increased much faster than the number of pingable
addresses until 2011. Even since 2011 the number of allocated

addresses increased faster than the number of pingable addresses.
On the other hand, the number of estimated used addresses is in-
creasing much faster than the number of pingable addresses with a
growth rate similar to the rate of the allocated and routed addresses
before their slowdown in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
6.9 Comparison with Internet user growth

We think the growth of the number of used IPv4 addresses is pri-
marily driven by an Internet user population increase, irrespective
of the number of devices per user. All home devices are behind
NATs and mobile devices are also largely behind NATs. Similarly,
if we look at increasingly complex commercial networks, these are
also mainly behind NATs (or not even connected to the Internet).
In this section we derive a very rough estimate of the IPv4 address
growth based on the Internet user growth and compare it with the
growth estimated with CR.

According to data from the ITU [27] the number of Internet
users has grown from 16 million in December 1995 to 2.75 bil-
lion (roughly 39% of the world’s population) in December 2013 as
shown in Figure 11. The growth rate of Internet users looks expo-
nential at the beginning of the graph, however since 2006/2007 the
growth appears roughly linear. This is consistent with the roughly
linear trend in our results shown in Section 6.3.

Between 2007 and 2012 the number of Internet users grew by
roughly 250 million per year (c.f. Figure 11). For private use typ-

Figure 9: Average absolute and relative yearly growth of observed and estimated IPv4 addresses for diﬀerent countries sorted by estimated
growth (only the largest 42 countries). Note, the absolute numbers are plotted in log scale.

ically a household shares one public IP address. In industrial na-
tions the household size is 2–3, but in developing countries it can
be higher, for example it is over 5 in India [28]. We assume the
average household size of new Internet users is between 2 and 5.

In addition a fraction of new users will get a public IPv4 address
at work. We assume an average employment ratio of 65% [29].
We could not ﬁnd any data on the number of average public IP
addresses used per employee, so we are assuming a wide possible
range. As upper limit we assume on average one IPv4 address per
two employees, as in reality many employees (especially in devel-
oping countries) have no Internet at work, work at home, or share
computers with other workers. As a lower limit we assume on av-
erage there is one public address per 200 workers.

Let gU be the user growth per year, H the average household
size, pE the employment ratio, and W the average number of em-
ployees sharing an IP at work. Then the IP address growth is
gI = (1/H + pE/W) gU. Based on the above ranges of H and W,
we would expect the IPv4 addresses to grow between 50 million
and 205 million per year (plus additional addresses for service and
infrastructure growth). Our CR growth estimate from Section 6.3 is
170 million IPv4 addresses per year, which ﬁts within this range.

7. UNUSED SPACE PREDICTION

Our CR technique tells us how many unobserved IPv4 ad-
dresses to expect, but says nothing about the distribution of free
blocks/preﬁxes. This is a challenging issue – recipients of newly
assigned IPv4 address blocks typically prefer usably-sized contigu-
ous allocations, and forwarding information base (FIB) tables in
routers are more eﬃciently packed if address blocks are allocated
hierarchically.

Some information is given by the CR estimate of the used but
unobserved /24 networks (in Figure 4). However, this again does
not tell us whether these small blocks are isolated or parts of un-
used larger blocks. In this section, we try to understand how the
unseen addresses are distributed among seemingly empty subnets,
by observing what happens when data sources are combined se-
quentially; each new source brings addresses that were unseen by
the previous sources, and we can model how those addresses ﬁll
the previously empty space.
7.1 Model

Let xi be the number of observed free /i blocks. Let Z00...0 be the
total number of new addresses to allocate (given by CR). Let Ni
be the number of new addresses assumed to be allocated to vacant
/i blocks, assuming sequential allocation. Speciﬁcally, if two ad-

number of such free blocks. In particular, it assumes that there are

remains approximately constant as more batches of addresses are
discovered.

The model includes subnets larger than /8, even though blocks
larger than /8 have not been allocated. Similarly, we consider all
vacant subnets down to vacant /32s, even though subnets smaller
than a /24 are not routed on the public Internet. However, before
computing the remaining unused preﬁxes we split a few /7 into
/8, and we also exclude all private, multicast, experimental and re-
served preﬁxes, such as 224.0.0.0/3 or 10.0.0.0/8. Note that we do
not exclude non-publicly routed preﬁxes.

To determine how the unobserved addresses predicted by CR
will aﬀect the distribution of free blocks, it remains to determine
fi. To do this, we observe the change in x when a new data set ∆
is added to an existing list S of used IPv4 addresses, and from that
calculate n. Since A in (3) is invertible, (2) gives

nS ,∆ = A−1(xS∪∆ − xS ).

The fi are then found by (4), normalized so that f32 = 1. Since few
large subnets become newly used for each data set, estimates of fi
for i (cid:46) 12 are noisy. This is unfortunate, since these are the blocks
of greatest interest. To reduce this noise, estimates were averaged
over four cases: ∆ = IPING, GAME, WEB, WIKI; in each case, S
is the union of all remaining datasets, except SWIN and CALT.

One concern with this model is that, as the address space ﬁlls
up, the values of fi may vary. To check this, we performed tests
where datasets were added to S one at a time, in both increasing and
decreasing order of the dataset size. The values were reasonably
consistent in each case.
7.2 Results

Figure 12 shows the number of addresses in unused preﬁxes at 30
June 2014, based on all sources except SWIN and CALT. Results
are for both direct observation and CR. The majority of empty pre-
ﬁxes are longer than /20 (fewer than 212 addresses), but the unused
space is roughly uniformly distributed among preﬁxes of lengths /9
to /24 (except /15 and /16). The reason for this is unclear.

If the used but unobserved /8 to /24 subnets estimated by the
model of Section 7.1 were divided into /24s, there would be 0.3

dresses are added to the same vacant /i, then only the ﬁrst of these
contributes to Ni , since the block is no longer vacant when the
second one is added.

Similarly, let xS

i be the number of free /i blocks in a set S of
addresses, ZS ,∆
00...0 be the number of new addresses when a new set
∆ is merged with S , and nS ,∆
be the number of addresses added to
vacant /i blocks in the process. Without the subscript i, the variables
x and n denote vectors.

Note that adding an address to a vacant /i will reduce the number
of vacant /i blocks by 1, but increase by one the number of / j blocks
for each j > i, regardless of where within the /i the address is added.

A natural approach is to estimate the previous fraction of ad-
dresses revealed by each new source that have been allocated to
free blocks of a given size, and assume the new Z0,0,...,0 addresses
will be distributed in the same way. This is not suﬃcient, because
the allocation process changes the number of available blocks. In-
stead, our model uses the observation that the probability that a

This is consistent with the estimate of 0.26–0.36 mil-
lion by the independent LLM model for the period ending at 30
June 2014, providing evidence for the validity of both models.
7.2.1 Router FIB limitations
One of the reasons that the distribution of preﬁx sizes is impor-
tant is that each routed preﬁx requires an entry in a router’s For-
warding Information Base (FIB), and there is a prima facie risk
that allocating all unused preﬁxes could overﬂow the FIBs. Above
we estimated that including the unrouted space there are 0.78 mil-
lion preﬁxes that are /24 or larger. Currently, there are more than
0.5 million routed preﬁxes already (but a substantial fraction is un-
used). In 2007 Juniper [30] stated that its M120 and MX960 had
FIB capacities of about 2 million IPv4 routes, and that IPv4 FIBs
with approximately 10 million entries are feasible within a few
years if demand exists. In addition, FIB compression techniques
can reduce size of FIBs [30]. This suggests that it will be feasible
to use and route all less than 1.3 million available preﬁxes. Even if
unused preﬁxes are subdivided further, it appears feasible to route
them all. However, some existing routers may require upgrades.
7.2.2 Estimated years of supply
In July 2014 roughly 5.5 /8 networks of unallocated addresses
remained [1] – equivalent to 350,000 /24 networks or 90 million
addresses. Even if in addition to these all 4.4 million routed but
unused /24 subnets could be prised away from their current owners,
/24 networks would be exhausted in 2024 under the current growth
trend of 0.45 million /24 subnets per year. Unused routed IPv4
addresses would be exhausted in 2023 given the current growth of
170 million addresses per year.

The overall estimate hides the diﬀerences between regions. Ta-
ble 6 shows the available space (unallocated space plus allocated
publicly routed unused space based on our CR estimates), the cur-
rent average growth rate over our measured time period and the
predicted year supply will run out (under the very optimistic as-
sumption that the whole unused space could be utilised) for IPs and
/24 networks for each RIR. For most RIRs the number of years of
IP supply is equal or smaller than the number of years of /24 net-
works supply. This is because either the IP and /24 growth rates
are similar or the IP growth rate is larger, but there are signiﬁcant
numbers of unused IPs in used /24. RIPE is an exception due to
similar growth rates for IPs and /24s and signiﬁcant supply in al-
ready used blocks. At current growth rates ARIN and RIPE have
14+ years of IP supply left, but AfriNIC has only 8–9 years of sup-
ply left, and LACNIC and APNIC have only 2–4 years of supply
left. Any future reallocations between RIRs to ease local pressures
would change these numbers of course.

However, it appears unlikely that the whole IPv4 space will ever
be completely utilised. If the overall utilization of routed /24 sub-
nets remains below, say 75%, the current growth rates suggests
four years of remaining supply overall. Moreover, in this case re-
gions with tight supply, such as APNIC and LACNIC, would be ex-
hausted within one year. APNIC stands out, because its IP growth
rate is much larger than its /24 growth rate with unused IPs in used
/24s depleted soon. We expect a slowdown shortly – in fact Fig-
ure 6 suggests it may have begun already. An open question is the
large amount of unrouted IPv4 space, much of which has not been
routed for years. Unused parts of the unrouted space might provide
a short-lived increase in IPv4 supply.

Over the next one to two years, we expect IPv4 exhaustion to
be increasingly felt, resulting in a brief growth in the IPv4 address
market. Most organizations holding unused addresses do so for
operational reasons – to allow expansion or ﬂexibility, or in one

case as a /8 darknet – but some may be holding them to sell if
the market price rises suﬃciently. The numbers in this paper may
guide how long they can expect to be held for, assuming that the
market will collapse once IPv6 is widely adopted. However, this is
complicated by the fact that the very act of selling a large block of
IPv4 addresses will delay the implementation of IPv6, and hence
prolong the IPv4 market.

8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Our key contribution is describing and demonstrating a new sta-
tistical capture-recapture technique for improved estimation of the
true population of both observed and unobserved (yet still active)
IPv4 addresses from diverse sources of active and passive measure-
ment data. This technique reﬁnes our community’s understand-
ing of IPv4 address space exhaustion and consequent incentives for
IPv6 adoption.

Data from nine sources over the past three years suggests 5.9
million used /24 subnets and 740 million used IPv4 addresses. Yet
our CR technique indicates a signiﬁcantly higher 1.2 billion IPv4
addresses in use across 6.3 million /24 subnets, with usage growing
at around 0.45 million /24 subnets and 170 million IPv4 addresses
per year. Asia and Europe have the highest numbers of used IP ad-
dresses, while Africa and South America show the fastest growth.
Based on the overall estimates, at the very best unallocated plus
routed but unused addresses will last until 2023. More likely, if
say only 75% of routed /24 subnets could ever be used, supply will
be exhausted in 2018. Moreover, Asia and South America are the
two “pressure points” that will experience a shortage of addresses
within the next one or two years.

Previous sales of IP addresses saw prices of US$8–17 per IP
depending on the sizes of the blocks sold [31, 32]. At an average
price of US$10 per IP address, the 4.4 million routed unused /24
subnets have a value of over US$11 billion. However, probably
only a small fraction of those will be sold, so even if prices rise
substantially, the eventual market value is likely to be smaller.

Our ability to collect more IP data for validating or improving
our estimates, or potentially detecting more hosts (e.g. private
servers), is limited by common privacy restrictions. We plan to ex-
plore an enhanced method [33] for securely applying CR to multi-
source measurement data without revealing which IPv4 addresses
each source contains.
