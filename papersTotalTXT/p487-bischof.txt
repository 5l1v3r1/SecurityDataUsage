ABSTRACT
The goal of our work is to characterize the current state of
Cuba’s access to the wider Internet. This work is motivated
by recent improvements in connectivity to the island and the
growing commercial interest following the ease of restrictions
on travel and trade with the US. In this paper, we proﬁle
Cuba’s networks, their connections to the rest of the world,
and the routes of international traﬃc going to and from
the island. Despite the addition of the ALBA-1 submarine
cable, we ﬁnd that round trip times to websites hosted
oﬀ the island remain very high; pings to popular websites
frequently took over 300 ms. We also ﬁnd a high degree
of path asymmetry in traﬃc to/from Cuba. Speciﬁcally, in
our analysis we ﬁnd that traﬃc going out of Cuba typically
travels through the ALBA-1 cable, but, surprisingly, traﬃc
on the reverse path often traverses high-latency satellite
links, adding over 200 ms to round trip times. Last, we
analyze queries to public DNS servers and SSL certiﬁcate
requests to characterize the availability of network services
in Cuba.

INTRODUCTION

It may have taken 54 years, but change is coming to
Cuba. Last December, the US government announced plans
to restore relations with Cuba and ease restrictions on travel
and trade.
It took little time for American businesses
– from the obvious tourist sector to telephony and video
streaming services – to start scouting opportunities.
In
February, IDT Corp reached an agreement with the Empresa

de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba, S.A. (ETECSA) to provide
direct international
long distance telephony between the
USA and Cuba [16]. The same month, Netﬂix announced
their plan to oﬀer their video streaming service and two
months later Airbnb brought their sharing economy to the
island [3].

Despite the promising news, the state of Cuban infrastruc-
ture, particularly in the computing and network segment,
pose no small challenges to these plans. Today, less than
5% of the population have their own ﬁxed-line Internet
connection [18] and only an estimated 25% of the population
are able to get online [9]. Those that are actually connected
experience very poor performance. Ookla’s NetIndex, for
instance, ranks Cuba among the worst ten countries in
terms of average bandwidth – 197th out of 202 – with a
measured broadband download speed of 1.67 Mbps. An even
bigger barrier to Internet access is cost with services that are
prohibitively expensive for much of the population. While
the average monthly income in Cuba is around $20 a month,
paying by the hour at an Internet cafe can cost about $5 per
hour [19]. A broadband subscription is even more expensive
with private subscription plans costing about 386% of the
gross national income per capita [6].

Recent years have brought some progress in connecting
Cubans to the rest of the Internet and the recent commercial
interest may help speed up the process. In February of 2011,
Cuba completed its ﬁrst undersea ﬁber-optic cable, ALBA-1
(640 Gbps), with landings in Jamaica and Venezuela. The
US government has also set the promotion of Internet access
in the island as one of their top priorities [17] and the US
Department of Defense stated plans to build a submarine
cable between Florida and the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base
in Cuba and to eventually extend it to the rest of Cuba [15].
Our goal is to characterize the current state of Cuba’s
access to the wider Internet. We collected and analyzed
two months of measurements (March and April of 2015)
with probes going in and out of Cuba launched from 50
RIPE Atlas [13] nodes and our 6,000 Namehelp [12] clients.
Our analysis validates some of the anecdotal evidence on
the limited connectivity of the island. Though bandwidth
capacity to the country is severely limited, we ﬁnd that
end-to-end latency is a key bottleneck in international
network traﬃc with a large number of paths traversing
high-latency satellite links despite the availability of ALBA-
1.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd that many of the high RTT
measurements are linked to high degrees of path asymmetry
in traﬃc to/from Cuba. Speciﬁcally, most traﬃc going
out of Cuba travels through the ALBA-1 submarine cable,

487The ALBA-1 cable was not actually activated until two
years later, in January 2013 [11]. Even after the addition
of ALBA-1, Cuba’s connectivity to the rest of the Internet
remains relatively poor, even compared to other Caribbean
islands. Figure 1 shows a map of the submarine cables in
the region. Despite the large number of cables in the sur-
rounding area, Cuba is one of the least connected countries
in the region, with a number of submarine cables detouring
around the island in order to reach their destination.

Aﬀordability remains a problem, with a broadband sub-
scription costing close to 4x the gross national income per
capita [6], but in March of 2015, the Cuban government
approved the ﬁrst public Wi-Fi hub in Havana [2] potentially
improving citizens’ (and visitors’) access to the Internet.

3. DATASETS

To characterize the current state of Cuba’s connections to
the rest of the Internet we collected measurements over a
two month period (March and April, 2015). Probes going in
and out of Cuba were launched from RIPE Atlas [13] nodes
and our Namehelp [12] clients. The following paragraphs
describe our datasets in more detail.

RIPE Atlas probes. The RIPE Atlas data was collected
from approximately 50 probes across North and South
America. One probe was located in Cuba (the only available
one) and approximately half of rest were located on other
islands throughout the Caribbean, including the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Saint Barth´elemy, Saint
Kitts and Nevis, Guadeloupe, Trinidad and Tobago, Mar-
tinique, and Grenada. The rest of the probes were located in
the US, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil. Most of our analysis
in this paper focuses on the measurements collected from the
Atlas probe located in Havana, Cuba.

The RIPE Atlas API allows us to schedule ping and
traceroute measurements, issue DNS queries, and fetch SSL
certiﬁcates on each of these nodes. We measured the routes
between each vantage point by running traceroutes between
all pairs of our selected RIPE Atlas probes. Additionally,
the RIPE Atlas probe in Cuba ran traceroute measurements
to every Namehelp endhost. To test the availability of
network services in Cuba, we had the Atlas probe in Havana
fetch SSL certiﬁcates for popular websites that supported
HTTPS. We also measured DNS performance to the probes’
conﬁgured DNS server and to a number of public DNS
services. We compared the results of these tests to other
requests issued simultaneously from the other 49 Atlas
probes. These measurements are discussed in greater detail
in Sec. 6.

Namehelp clients.

In addition to the RIPE Atlas
data, we also leveraged 6,000 endhosts running Namehelp,
with presence in over 600 networks across 78 countries.
Namehelp is a tool based on the popular DNS benchmark
utility, namebench, that aims to both provide a comparative
evaluation of DNS services and act as a DNS proxy to
improve CDN mappings. 1

Namehelp is also able to conduct controlled network
measurements, such as ping, traceroute, or wget. For
this dataset, Namehelp clients ran hourly traceroute mea-
surements to preﬁxes located in Cuba. While running
these traceroutes, Namehelp did not run any other network
measurements simultaneously. By combining this data with

but on the reverse path, responses often traverse satellite
links, typically adding over 200 ms of additional end-to-
end latency. We also survey a number of popular network
services, such as public DNS and web services, checking their
availability in Cuba, ﬁnding that some services appear to be
blocking users in the island.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we
discuss the state of Internet connectivity in Cuba. Section 3
describes the datasets that we use for our analysis. We
then discuss the domestic and international connectivity of
Cuba’s networks in Sec. 4 and look at how routing through
these connections aﬀects performance in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6,
we discuss our preliminary ﬁndings on the availability of
network services in Cuba before concluding in Sec. 7.

2. BACKGROUND

Although Cubans have been able to legally acquire a
computer since 2008 [8], getting access to the Internet
has remained a challenge. Network availability has been
problematic for such a long time that several makeshift
“oﬄine Internets” have appeared, with individuals and
companies sharing or selling content downloaded from the
Internet (e.g., ﬁlms, TV shows, magazines, news articles, or
applications) via USB ﬂash drives or CDs – a popular service
known as “El paquete” [18].

if slowly.

Things have been changing,

In early 2011,
Alcatel-Lucent began work on a submarine ﬁber-optic cable,
named ALBA-1, with landing points in Ocho Rios, Jamaica;
Siboney, Cuba; and La Guaira, Venezuela [1]. Estimates
suggested that this link would increase capacity to the island
by a factor of 3,000.

Prior to this, all traﬃc was routed to and from the
island via satellite links. These satellites are located in
geosynchronous orbit, at a distance of about 36,000 km
from the equator.
Sending a single packet from the
Earth’s surface to the satellite and back to Earth takes
approximately 2 × 36, 000 km/c = 240 ms where c is the
speed of light. Traversing a satellite link on both the forward
and reverse path would add approximately 480 ms to RTT
measurements.

488traceroutes from Namehelp users to the island, we found
that of the 20 IPv4 preﬁxes in AS27725, 15 of the preﬁxes
appeared to be consistently routed over the ALBA-1 cable
on both the forward and reverse paths. Looking at the
forward paths going into Cuba, it is clear that traceroutes
to these preﬁxes did not travel through either Intelsat’s or
NewCom’s networks (satellite link). Considering that the
end-to-end RTT was always less than 200 ms, it is also clear
that the reverse path did not traverse the satellite link as
this would have added over 230 ms.

The ﬁve remaining preﬁxes were frequently routed asym-
metrically; traﬃc traveling out of the country went through
the ALBA-1 cable into either Tata’s or Telefonica’s network,
while incoming traﬃc was, in the majority of cases, routed
through one of the satellite networks.

Using a list of popular Cuban websites [7], we also
looked at where websites under the .cu TLD were hosted
geographically. Of the websites ending with .cu that we were
able to successfully resolve, about 80% were located in the
island. Cuban websites that were located outside of Cuba
were typically in the US, France, Venezuela, or Canada. Of
the listed websites that were hosted in Cuba, about 60%
were located in a single preﬁx, 190.91.112.0/20. Domains
that were hosted in other Cuban preﬁxes were typically
government websites, in the preﬁx assigned to the respective
government organization.

5. PERFORMANCE

With an understanding of the island connectivity, we now
look at how the routing of international traﬃc to and from
Cuba aﬀects end-to-end RTT performance. We start by
looking at individual cases where asymmetry is causing a
signiﬁcant increase in RTT, before discussing how frequently
this issue occurs across all measurements in our global
dataset.
5.1 Case studies

As we mentioned in the previous section, we found a high
degree of path asymmetry in Cuban international traﬃc.
Unfortunately, since there is only one available probe in
Cuba, we are only able to verify the outgoing path from
a single preﬁx. However, based on RTT measurements,
this asymmetry appears to apply to the preﬁxes that route
incoming traﬃc via the satellite networks.

We compute the AS path for each traceroute in our
dataset using the methodology presented in Chen et. al. [5].
We then match traceroutes with opposite source and desti-
nation IP address to get the forward and reverse path and
calculate the asymmetry of the path [10, 14].

Figure 3 shows one example of path asymmetry to/from
Cuba. In this case, traceroutes were run simultaneously by
Atlas nodes in Havana, Cuba and Miami, Florida (in NTT’s
network), with each node targeting the other.

We start with the traceroute launched by the Atlas node in
Cuba, shown on the top half of Figure 3. RTT measurements
to the edge of the Cuban IXP were very low, typically taking
less than 3 ms. The ﬁrst jump in latency occurs as the
traceroute leaves AS12956 and enters Telefonica’s transit
network. Though we were unable to verify the exact location
of this hop, we believe that it likely located in Venezuela;
the only other landing of the ALBA-1 submarine is located
in Jamaica and is reportedly intended to be a backup. The
next hop is still in Telefonica’s network, but there is another

we were able to construct the forward and reverse path
between Namehelp users and this Atlas probe.

4. CONNECTIVITY

In this section, we brieﬂy describe the structure of
Cuba’s networks and its connectivity to the global Internet.
According to Preﬁx WhoIs, there are a total of three Au-
tonomous Systems (ASes) in Cuba, two of which (AS11960
and AS27725) are operated by ETECSA, a government-
owned telecommunications service provider. The third AS
(AS10569) is operated by Centro de Intercambio Automati-
zado de Informacion (CENIAI). All international traﬃc to
and from the island ﬂows through AS11960. Table 1 lists
the number of IPv4 and IPv6 preﬁxes in each of the Cuban
ASes.

Using the traceroute measurements launched from Name-
help clients targeting each preﬁx in Cuba [4, 5], we created
the AS map in Figure 2, which describes how these three
networks are connected to each other and to the rest
of the Internet (via the four ASes listed on the right
side of the diagram). Before reaching Cuba, all of our
traceroute measurements traversed one of four networks:
Tata’s, Telefonica’s, NewCom’s, or the Intelsat’s network.
Traﬃc that travels through Tata’s (AS6453) or Telefonica’s
(AS12956) networks appears to travel to Cuba via the
ALBA-1 submarine cable as it leaves those networks. Paths
that reach Cuba via Intelsat’s (AS222351) or Newcom’s
(AS27725) networks are reaching the island via satellite.

In AS11960, we found that one of the IPv4 preﬁxes
(200.13.144.0/21) hosts a small number of domains, includ-
ing cubacel.cu, a website for ETECSA. The remaining IPv4
and IPv6 preﬁxes are part of the Cuban Internet Exchange
Point (IXP). All of our measurements into and out of Cuba
ﬂow through this IXP.

In AS27725, a number of preﬁxes are assigned to gov-
ernmental and educational organizations. After analyzing

signiﬁcant jump in RTT. Based on traceroute measurements
to this router’s IP address from Atlas probes in the US, this
hop appears to be near Washington DC; the Atlas probe
with the shortest latency to this probe (less than 1 ms) was
located in the DC metropolitan area.

Once the traceroute from Cuba to Miami had a high
enough TTL to reach a router in NTT’s network, RTT
suddenly increases by over 200 ms. Based on the router’s
hostname, the router is located near Ashburn, Virginia, and
is likely within 60 km of the previous hop. In fact, once the
TTL was high enough to leave Telefonica’s network, RTT
was never below 345 ms.

The reason for this sudden jump in latency becomes clear
when examining the reverse path. The dashed arrows and
RTTs on the bottom of Figure 3 summarize the output of
the traceroute initiated by the probe in NTT’s network.
Instead of routing through Telefonica’s network, probes from
the Atlas node in Miami are being routed to Cuba via
AT&T’s transit network to NewCom’s network, traversing
the satellite link to the island.
Interestingly, the RTT
actually reaches its highest point once the path arrives at
the NewCom’s base station in Cuba. At this point, packets
must travel over the satellite link in both directions (which
must take at least 477 ms). Once the TTL is high enough to
reach the Cuban network, RTT drops by over 200 ms, as the
traceroute responses are now returning via the submarine
cable.

Although this example only covers a single forward and
reverse path between Atlas probes in Cuba and Florida, the
sudden jumps in latency and path asymmetry were both
common when measuring between Cuba and the US. In
our analysis of paths between the Atlas node in Cuba and
Namehelp users in the US, we found that all paths going
out of Cuba traversed the submarine cable and 92% of paths
going into Cuba traversed a satellite link.

This issue also appeared frequently on paths to popular
websites. Figure 4 summarizes the path of a traceroute from
the Atlas probe in Cuba to google.com. Despite the fact that
we were unable to run traceroutes along the reverse path
(from Google’s network to Cuba), the forward path is very

google.com. The latencies represent the RTT at
each hop. Hops with similar RTT in the same AS
have been omitted.

similar to the example in Figure 3; after leaving Telefonica’s
network, latency suddenly jumps by 220 ms.

Based on the hostname of the Google server targeted by
the Atlas node in Cuba, the server appeared to be located
near Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Ping measurements from
Atlas probes in the DC area (near the last hop in Telefonica’s
network) to the same Google server took less than 35 ms.
However, between Telefonica’s network and the destination,
RTT increases by 220 ms. Given the similarity to the
previous example, we believe that this sudden increase is
also a result of the reverse path being routed to Cuba via a
high latency satellite link. We observed this same trend for
all of the other top sites included in our tests (i.e., Yahoo,
Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit).

5.2 Wider impact

We now summarize the paths between our population of
Namehelp users and the Atlas probe in Cuba. Using the
Atlas node in Havana, we launched traceroutes targeting

each Namehelp user in our dataset. We found that all
traceroutes launched by this probe and targeting the IPs
of Namehelp users would leave the country via either Tata’s
and Telefonica’s network, avoiding the high-latency satellite
connections.

However, the reverse path (going into Cuba) was not
as consistent.
For each traceroute measurement from
Namehelp, we identiﬁed the last AS hop that appeared
before entering the Cuban IXP network (AS11960). We then
calculated the approximate distance between the Namehelp
user and the Atlas node using MaxMind’s GeoIP database to
map users’ IP addresses to geographic locations. Finally, we
grouped measurements according to the last AS seen before
entering Cuba.

Figure 5 shows the relationship between RTT and dis-
tance, grouped by the last AS before entering Cuba. The
gray dotted line represents the RTT of light moving through
a cable of length x (assuming that light is moving through
the medium at c/2). The green dashed line represents the
linear regression between distance and latency for each group
of vantage points. Below each ﬁgure, we also include the
equation of the linear regression. We ﬁnd that the slope of
the linear regression of measurements that travel through
satellite networks is similar to that of the measurements
traversing the submarine cable, but is approximately 180 ms
higher.

Despite the fact that approximately 40% of the Earth’s
surface should be able to communicate directly with satel-
lites in geostationary orbit, we were unable to ﬁnd any
satellite base stations outside of North America in either of
the satellite networks. As a result, packets headed to Cuba
had to ﬁrst be routed to North America and then to Cuba
over a satellite connection.

For example, packets originating in Europe had to ﬁrst
traverse an intercontinental submarine cable before travers-
ing a satellite link, even though some countries should be
within the satellite’s serviceable area. The slopes of the
linear regression lines are thus roughly consistent across each
group of users, and similar to the slope of the estimated
speed of light through a ﬁber cable. The diﬀerence in the y-
intercept of the regression lines in Figs. 5a and 5b when

Figure 6: CDFs of the RTT to Cuba, as measured
by users in each country.

compared to Figs. 5c and 5d is a result of traversing a
satellite link.

We also looked for trends between the origin of the
traceroute measurement and which network was used to
reach Cuba. We found that RTT could vary widely between
countries, even those in the same region, due to diﬀerences in
routing. In some cases, vantage points that were in countries
much further away from Cuba (e.g., in Europe) would have
signiﬁcantly lower RTTs than those in North and South
America.

Figure 6 shows the CDF of RTTs for users in France,
Spain, the US, the UK, and Venezuela. Latency measure-
ments from Namehelp users in France and Spain had the
lowest median latencies of all subpopulations in our dataset,
nearly half that of the median latency of users in the UK.
Despite the fact that users in the US and Venezuela are
much closer to Cuba, their RTTs were much higher. This
diﬀerence is due to the fact that most users in France
and Spain are routed to Cuba through Telefonica’s transit
network, and were sent via the ALBA-1 submarine cable

In total, 77% of routes to Cuba
from France and 94% of routes from Spain were routed over
the ALBA-1 submarine cable in both directions.

In contrast to previously reported networking perfor-
mance issues in developing countries, such as Ghana [20]
and Zambia [21], Cuba presents an interesting case in that
at least part of the performance issues can be attributed to
asymmetric routing and could be addressed via changes to
routing policy.

6. NETWORK SERVICE AVAILABILITY

We also survey a number of popular network services
and websites, checking their availability in Cuba. To test
website availability, we issued SSL certiﬁcate requests from
our set of 50 Atlas probes in North and South America to
4,434 domains supporting HTTPS from the top 10,000 most
popular websites.2 While we would have liked to test the
availability of any website, the RIPE Atlas API does not
support general HTTP tests. For every site, if the request
succeeded (replied with a valid certiﬁcate), we removed it
from our list. If the request failed, we tried four more times
before labeling the site as “unavailable”. The experiment
ran between August 31st and September 4th, 2015.

We found that, while most of the sites replied with a
valid certiﬁcate, requests from the Atlas probe in Cuba
timed out consistently across all ﬁve tests for 111 (2.5%)
of sites. Nearly every other Atlas probe was able to
successfully retrieve a valid SSL certiﬁcate from these
domains. Most of the “unavailable” websites in Cuba fall into
a few categories, such as ﬁnance-related (e.g., paypal.com,
bankofamerica.com, capitalone.com, and usbank.com), ad
network (e.g., adcash.com, adnetworkperformance.com, and
tradeadexchange.com), computer hardware (e.g., dell.com
and seagate.com), and adult content. A few of these
sites were registered by the same entity but provided
diﬀerent services or diﬀerent TLDs (e.g., capitalone.com
and capitaloneinvesting.com, blizzard.com and battle.net,
and the multiple TLDs of cam4.com), hinting at a parent
company policy. Table 2 list the percentage of websites per
category, along with a few examples.

We also found that many of the same sites we labeled
as unavailable in Cuba also timed out when requested from
Atlas probes in other US-sanctioned countries. Speciﬁcally,
51 of the 111 (46%) domains timed out when requests
originated from a probe in Sudan.

Beyond websites, we surveyed the availability of public
DNS services in Cuba and found all of those tested to be
reachable. A ﬁrst analysis showed as if some services were
unavailable; however, the result was due to the Recursion
Desired (RD) ﬂag of the request being unset by default in the
Atlas probe while many of the DNS servers are conﬁgured
to ignore requests with RD unset or respond with an empty
answer. We diagnosed the issue by comparing our results
with those of dig, which sets RD by default.

7. CONCLUSION

We have started to characterize the state of Cuba’s access
to the wider Internet. Our work is motivated by recent
improvements in connectivity to the island and the growing
commercial
interest following the ease of restrictions on
travel and trade with the US. This paper reports on some
