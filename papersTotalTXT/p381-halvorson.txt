ABSTRACT

1.

INTRODUCTION

The com, net, and org TLDs contain roughly 150 million regis-
tered domains, and domain registrants often have a difﬁcult time
ﬁnding a desirable and available name.
In 2013, ICANN began
delegation of a new wave of TLDs into the Domain Name Sys-
tem with the goal of improving meaningful name choice for regis-
trants. The new rollout resulted in over 500 new TLDs in the ﬁrst
18 months, nearly tripling the number of TLDs. Previous rollouts
of small numbers of new TLDs have resulted in a burst of defensive
registrations as companies aggressively defend their trademarks to
avoid consumer confusion. This paper analyzes the types of do-
main registrations in the new TLDs to determine registrant behav-
ior in the brave new world of naming abundance. We also exam-
ine the cost structures and monetization models for the new TLDs
to identify which registries are proﬁtable. We gather DNS, Web,
and WHOIS data for each new domain, and combine this with cost
structure data from ICANN, the registries, and domain registrars to
estimate the total cost of the new TLD program. We ﬁnd that only
15% of domains in the new TLDs show characteristics consistent
with primary registrations, while the rest are promotional, specu-
lative, or defensive in nature; indeed, 16% of domains with NS
records do not even resolve yet, and 32% are parked. Our ﬁnancial
analysis suggests only half of the registries have earned enough to
cover their application fees, and 10% of current registries likely
never will solely from registration revenue.

Nearly any successful company today needs a good Internet pres-
ence, and most see a memorable domain name as a key part of
that presence. Though a nearly inﬁnite set of possible domain
names exist, any given name is unique, and memorable names often
change hands for thousands or even millions of dollars. The Do-
main Name System (DNS) originally included only a small handful
of top-level domains (TLDs), and ICANN has kept that number low
until recent times. The beneﬁts of a new TLD seem obvious at ﬁrst
glance: simple and memorable strings, long since taken in the older
TLDs, become available again under a new namespace. However,
many registrations in new TLDs go towards defensive registrations,
brand or trademark owners trying to protect their names.

Starting in 2013, delegation began of a whole new wave of TLDs.
Whereas ICANN debated the inclusion of previous TLDs indepen-
dently and over the course of multiple ICANN board meetings,
TLDs in the new program go through a standard application process
which does not include ICANN-wide attention. The new expansion
has resulted in a swift expansion of the TLD namespace: on Octo-
ber 1, 2013, shortly before the beginning of the program, the root
zone contained 318 TLDs, mostly country code TLDs (ccTLDs).
As of April 15, 2015, the root zone contained 897 TLDs, an expan-
sion of 579 TLDs in less than two years.

This paper identiﬁes the impact of the New gTLD Program on
the domain name ecosystem. Previous TLD additions, such as
biz [12] and xxx [11], caused widespread speculation and defen-
sive registrations, but this larger expansion could discourage both.
With hundreds of new TLDs, we expect many smaller companies
to ﬁnd it infeasible to defend their name in each. Additionally, such
a sharp increase in simple-word second-level domains could make
it difﬁcult for speculators to resell even desirable names. The pro-
gram’s success also depends on how Internet users view the new
domains. Do consumers see TLDs as interchangeable, or will new
TLDs discourage users from visiting the associated domain? To
answer these questions, we make the following contributions:

• We classify registration intent with a methodology derived
from our work on xxx [11]. The application of the methodol-
ogy to the New gTLD Program presented additional scaling
difﬁculties, most notably requiring further automation of do-
main analysis. Our main contribution is the timely result of
this methodology applied to the TLD landscape during its
current period of swift expansion.

381• We determine the program’s impact on the old TLDs, both

on registration rates and on the types of registrations.

• We examine registry proﬁtability to learn where the reg-
istration money goes and what kinds of TLDs get the most
registrations.

Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that the new gTLDs have
yet to provide value to the Internet community in the same way as
legacy TLDs. Although the new TLDs greatly expand the domain
name space, overall we ﬁnd that speculative and defensive regis-
trations dominate the growth of registrations in new TLDs. For
domains that resolve with some kind of content, over 45% are spec-
ulative in nature, nearly 40% are defensive, and less than 15% host
primary Web content. Users also visit new domains in the new
TLDs less frequently than in the old, and new TLD domains are
more than twice as likely to appear on a blacklist within the ﬁrst
month of registration. Finally, we also ﬁnd that the new TLDs have
yet to have signiﬁcant impact on the old TLDs. Registrations in
the new TLDs generally increase the number of total registrations,
and com continues to dominate Internet domain name registration
activity overall.

2. BACKGROUND

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the Internet service that
maps human-readable names to machine addresses. In the Inter-
net today, the DNS is overseen by the Internet Corporation for As-
signed Names and Numbers (ICANN), which holds the authority
for establishing new top-level domains (TLDs). After a number
of minor TLD additions in the decade previous (e.g., biz, info,
mobi, xxx), ICANN initiated a new process in 2008 to normalize
the policies for creating new gTLDs. In late 2013, the ﬁrst new
gTLD was delegated. The length of this process reﬂects the signiﬁ-
cant complexity involved, the range of stakeholders and the signif-
icant potential for conﬂict. In this section, we provide background
on how the domain name ecosystem works, how companies apply
for a TLD in the new program, and who the signiﬁcant players are.

There are three key actors in the DNS ecosystem:

Registries operate TLDs and have a contract with ICANN

for each one.

Registrars sell domain names, typically in many different

TLDs, and also have an ICANN accreditation.

Registrants are entities that buy domain names.

and our goal in this paper is to explore how these actors have re-
acted to the rapid expansion of the DNS name space.

2.1 The Delegation Process

In preparation for the expansion, ICANN formalized a detailed
application process for those seeking to sponsor new TLDs (well
over 300 pages in English) [19]. Each applicant prepared an exten-
sive submission covering business, technical and operational issues
and paid a USD 185,000 evaluation fee for the initial evaluation.
These applications in turn were open to public comment and for re-
view by government interests and interested stakeholders. In such
cases, the TLD might undergo extended evaluation, dispute resolu-
tion, or a contention period when multiple applications pursue the
same TLD (and in such cases the fees could increase considerably).
With the addition of legal fees, drafting fees, data escrow fees, auc-
tions for contested names and operational costs, applications for a
new gTLD require signiﬁcant capital and thus favor those large or-
ganizations (e.g., Google, Amazon, Donuts) who would amortize
these expenses across many such applications.

Those applicants whose submission survived evaluation transi-
tioned to a phase called “delegation” (when the TLD is entered into
the zones of the root DNS servers) subject to a series of contractual
obligations (e.g., a registry agreement with ICANN covering dis-
pute resolution, fees, technical standards, etc.) and technical tests.
Delegation marks the time when end users can ﬁrst resolve domains
under the new TLD and is thus a major milestone for any registry.
Due to capacity constraints inside ICANN and changes in applicant
business goals, there can be considerable delay between evaluation
and delegation.

2.2 TLD Rollout

After delegation, the TLD life cycle depends on the registry.
TLDs intended for public use have a sunrise phase, a period of
time during which only trademark holders may register. This phase
gives brand holders a ﬁrst chance to defend their names. Most
TLDs follow with a “land rush” phase where registrants can get
an earlier chance at any domain name for a price premium, usu-
ally on the order of a few hundred dollars. Finally, public TLDs
will have a general availability phase, where registrations become
ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-served, and registrants just pay the standard yearly
registration rate for most names. Though ICANN has some min-
imum length standards for the sunrise phase, the registry chooses
the exact length of sunrise, domain pricing and promotions, and all
of the details about the other introductory phases.

A subset of TLDs are never made available for public registra-
tion. For these private TLDs, the only intended registrant is the
registry itself, frequently to protect a brand mark. For example, the
TLD aramco is closed to the public and only Saudi Aramco and its
afﬁliates can operate domains under this TLD.

2.3 Examples

The data for this paper comes from hundreds of new TLDs, many
of them managed by unique registries. We cannot describe all ac-
tors due to space limitations, but this section describes some of the
larger registries and their TLDs.

2.3.1 Donuts

Though most registries run one or a small handful of new TLDs,
Donuts Inc. is the largest and manages hundreds. Their TLDs
largely consist of topical English words, such as “singles”, “dig-
ital”, and “coffee”. The company’s founders each have years of
experience in the domain name industry, and the company secured
over USD 100 million in venture capital [9]. Another large registry,
Rightside, runs the technical infrastructure for Donuts TLDs. In re-
turn, Donuts gives some of its TLDs to Rightside after they reach
delegation.

2.3.2 The xyz TLD

The xyz TLD is a generic alternative to com and is the largest
in the new program. In the middle of 2014, Network Solutions, a
large registrar, began offering xyz domains for free to some of their
customers on an opt-out basis (e.g., the owner of example.com
would ﬁnd the domain example.xyz had appeared in their ac-
count). While registrants received these domains for free, Network
Solutions still paid the registry full price for each domain [16, 26],
although documents released as part of a lawsuit by Verisign sug-
gest Network Solutions may have paid for these domains with ad-
vertising credit [8].

Due to this promotion, the number of registered domains in xyz
rose by thousands per day in its earliest days until early August,
when the number of registrations slowed to around 428,806 do-
mains. Since then, xyz registrations appear at a much lower rate:

382the number of domains ﬁnally doubled on April 13, 2015, taking
over eight months to register a number of domains that originally
took only two.

Registrants, however, appear to have only limited interest in these
free domains. In our data set, 351,457 xyz domains (46% of xyz)
remain unused and display a standard Network Solutions registra-
tion page when visited in a Web browser. Upon further analysis,
we ﬁnd that 351,440 of these domains appeared in the zone ﬁle in
its ﬁrst two months and still showed the unused Network Solutions
template six months later. In fact, 82% of the 428,806 xyz domains
in the August 2, 2014 zone ﬁle originated from this promotion and
remained unclaimed as of early February 3, 2015. According to the
monthly reports, Network Solutions had acted as registrar for only
360,683 xyz domains at the end of July, 2015, so registrants from
this promotion claimed fewer than 10,000 free domains in the ﬁrst
six months.

2.3.3 The science TLD

The science TLD allows generic registrations, but targets the
scientiﬁc community. Starting with general availability on Febru-
ary 24, 2015, the AlpNames registrar offered science TLDs for
free. Similar to xyz, this promotion appears to have signiﬁcantly
impacted the number of science registrations: within only a few
days, the TLD boasted 36,952 unique domains. The promotion
has since ended, but the AlpNames registrar still sells science
domains for $0.50, making it one of the cheapest TLDs. Two
months after the start of general availability it had 174,403 reg-
istrations. Even though general availability started after our cutoff
date, science is already the third largest TLD.

2.3.4 The realtor TLD

The National Association of Realtors owns the realtor TLD
and targets accredited realtors, but also requires all registrants to
prove that they are members of their association [22]. The reg-
istry provides the ﬁrst year of registration for free to anyone that
provides their NAR membership information. The promotion only
applies to a single domain per NAR membership number. 46,920
realtor domains (51%) still show the default Web template pro-
vided by the registrar.

3. DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE

We use data from many sources in our analysis, including zone
ﬁles and several reports from ICANN. We actively crawl Web and
DNS for each domain, and compare our ﬁndings with Alexa rank-
ings and various blacklists.
In this section we describe our data
sources and data collection infrastructure.

3.1 Zone Files

When a registrant purchases a new domain from a registrar, the
registrar sends a request to the registry with the domain and name
server information. Once the domain goes live, it will appear in that
TLD’s zone ﬁle. At a high level, a zone ﬁle reﬂects a snapshot of a
DNS server’s anticipated answers to DNS queries. For a domain to
resolve, it must have name server information in the zone ﬁle.

ICANN requires most registries to provide zone ﬁle access for
a variety of purposes, including research. Some registries, such as
most ccTLDs, do not need to provide access. For zones delegated
prior to 2013, we gained access to their zone ﬁles by signing and
faxing a paper contract to the TLD’s registry, each of which gave
us FTP credentials. We originally used this method to gain access
to aero, biz, com, info, name, net, org, us, and xxx.

In anticipation for the rapid TLD expansion, ICANN developed
a more scalable solution to zone ﬁle access requests, known as the

Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS). Registries and interested
third parties can all apply for accounts on the service. After ﬁlling
out their online proﬁle with contact information and project details,
requesting access to multiple zone ﬁles becomes straightforward.
Registries still see multiple requests and can approve or deny them
individually, but the process is much simpler. Once the registry pro-
vides access, the user can download the zone ﬁle through a simple
API call up to once per day. Older TLDs can migrate to the new
system for zone access, but progress has been slow; so far, only
museum, coop, and xxx have migrated.

We have an account on CZDS, and manually refresh all new or
expired approval requests almost once per day.1 We have access to
the zone ﬁles for hundreds of domains, most using the new CZDS
system. We download a new snapshot of each daily, totaling 3.8
GB of gzipped text, more than half from com. For the analysis in
this paper we simplify the zones and store all NS, A, and AAAA
records on our HDFS cluster, and then store the raw zones on our
archive server for future use.

3.2 ICANN Public Data

ICANN also requires each registry to provide a handful of sum-
mary reports. We have used most of them at some point in our
methodology. The monthly transaction reports are particularly use-
ful for our study. ICANN requires each registry to publish monthly
summary statistics about the number of domains registered, trans-
ferred, expired, and renewed for each accredited registrar. We use
the monthly summary reports to identify the number of registered
domains that do not have any name server information and there-
fore do not appear in the zone ﬁle. We also use their breakdown of
domains per registrar when estimating registration costs.

We also relied upon ICANN’s New gTLD Current Application
Status listing [20]. We used the data provided to determine TLD
status and registry information as the new TLDs worked through
the application system.

3.3 Our TLD Set

We include results for new TLDs that started general availability
by the date of publication of ICANN’s latest monthly registry re-
ports on January 31, 2015, which altogether totals 502 new TLDs.
Table 1 breaks down these new TLDs into various high-level cate-
gories, together with the total number of new domains registered in
them at the time we crawled them.

We have focused our analysis on why registrants spend money
on domains in the new TLD program. Some companies defensively
register private TLDs, while others simply want a shorter domain
name for their services. However, some companies in the latter
category have not established their presence in their new TLDs yet,
so we do not have a methodology to differentiate between these
cases. Thus, we are more interested in public TLDs, where we can
establish the registrant intent of individual domain names.

We differentiate public and private TLDs by checking public in-
formation about the start of general availability, as provided by sev-
eral large domain registrars and nTLDStats [21], a Web site that
tracks information on the new TLD program and is well-regarded
in the domain community. Registries include their TLDs in these
listings when they want public registrations, since the registrar col-
lects this list in anticipation of selling domains in the TLD. This
classiﬁcation technique held up to the 15 randomly sampled pri-
vate domains we veriﬁed manually. With this classiﬁcation, 128 of
the 502 new TLDs are private.

1We considered scripting our requests, but CZDS blocked obvious
scripting attempts, so we did not pursue this further.

3, 2015, and their sizes. For the three TLDs for which we had
pending access requests, we used the size of the closest zone ﬁle.

Table 2: The ten largest TLDs in our public set with their general
availability dates.

In addition to the above, we found it difﬁcult to learn substan-
tial information about the new internationalized TLDs. In many
cases, registrants can only purchase domains for them from inter-
national registrars. They tend to have rules for sunrise and general
availability that we found unclear even with the help of a native
speaker. As a result, we also do not include these 44 new TLDs
in our analysis. Additionally, we focus on domains that reached
general availability (GA) before our February 3, 2015 Web crawl
so the set of registrants can include all prospective domain owners.
After removing private and internationalized TLDs from those
that had already began general availability, we end with a set of 290
new public TLDs. The total set of TLDs includes generic words
like bike and academy and geographical regions like berlin and
london, both represented in Table 1. Additionally, four TLDs gate
registrations to members of a particular community, such as the
realtor TLD for accredited realtors. To give a sense of how many
common word TLDs exist, our data set contains four synonyms
for “picture”: photo (12,933 domains), photos (17,500 domains),
pics (6,506 domains), and pictures (4,633 domains). Table 2
gives an overview of the largest TLDs in our set, with some of the
geographic TLDs featuring prominently. In the rest of this paper,
we restrict our analyses to these 290 TLDs.

3.4 Active Web

For each domain in the zone ﬁle of a new gTLD, we visit the
Web page hosted on port 80 of the domain with a crawler based
on Firefox, an improved version of the crawler used in our previ-
ous study of xxx [11]. Our browser-based Web crawler executes
JavaScript, loads Flash, and in general renders the page as close
as possible to what an actual user would see. We also follow redi-
rects of all kinds. After the browser loads all resources sent by the
remote server, we capture the DOM and any JavaScript transforma-
tions it has made. We also fetch page headers, the response code,
and the redirect chain.

Our primary data set for this paper is our Web crawl of all do-
mains in the new TLDs on February 3, 2015. We chose this date
due to its proximity to the timing of the latest ICANN reports,
which reﬂect the number of registered domains in each TLD as
of the end of January 2015.

3.5 Active DNS

Every time we Web crawl a domain, we also perform a DNS
query using a DNS crawler developed for [15]. We follow CNAME
and NS records and continue to query until we ﬁnd an A or AAAA
record, or determine that no such record exists. We save every
record we ﬁnd along the chain. We use DNS data to detect invalid
NS records and to annotate each Web crawl with its CNAME chain.

3.6 Active WHOIS

Registry operators for most TLDs must publicly provide accurate
domain ownership data using the WHOIS protocol. ICANN intends
the use of WHOIS for “any lawful purpose except to enable mar-
keting or spam, or to enable high volume, automated processes to
query a registrar or registry’s systems” [14]. In particular, ICANN
encourages its use by consumers, registrars, and law enforcement,
and discourages its use by spammers [29].

WHOIS server operators have leeway in how they achieve these
goals. They typically rate limit requests, and responses do not need
to conform to any standard format, which causes parsing difﬁculty
even once records are properly fetched. We only query WHOIS for
a small percentage of domains in the new gTLD program as an
investigative step towards understanding ownership and intent.

3.7 Pricing Data

One dimension of our analysis focuses on the economic im-
pact of the new TLD program, a task that requires domain pric-
ing information. Unfortunately for our data collection purposes,
registries do not sell domain names directly, but instead sell them
through ICANN-accredited registrars. A registry can sell their do-
main names through any registrars they choose, but each must get
similar wholesale prices and promotions [5].

We gathered pricing data for domains in the new gTLDs from
a wide range of registrars. First, we collected data from the most
common registrars for as many TLDs as possible. In some cases
the registrar included a pricing table with information for many
TLDs and we were able to automate the data collection process.
Other registrars only showed pricing information after querying a
domain name’s availability, which required many separate queries.
We made these queries manually. Some registrars made us solve a
single captcha after ﬁve to ten requests.

Obtaining pricing information for the most common registrars
simpliﬁes the process and allows us to obtain a large number of
(registrar, TLD) pairs in a short amount of time. However, we ulti-
mately want to estimate pricing per TLD, so we would like to have
registrar pricing data for many domain registrations in each TLD.
Some TLDs do not sell well or are not available at the most com-
mon registrars (e.g., geographical TLDs for non-Western regions).
We use the monthly registry reports to learn how many domains
each registrar manages in each TLD, and we collect pricing infor-
mation for the top ﬁve in each. Where possible, we also removed
registry-owned domains from our analysis, since they did not cost
anything. When registrars reported prices for non-standard time in-
tervals or in foreign currencies, we used the current exchange rate
to convert all prices to US dollars per year.

Week (mm/dd 2013-2014)

Figure 1: Number of new domains per day. Bars indicate the
average rate for each week.

Registries reserve a set of strings which they sell for increased
prices, known as premium domain names. For instance, GoDaddy
sells normal club domains for $10 USD, but universities.club
costs $5,000 USD, and this increase in price represents revenue
to both the registry and registrar. These domains number in the
thousands for any given TLD, and prices can vary per string. Our
methodology treats premium domains as normal domains, thus un-
derestimating registry and registrar revenue. Premium domain sales
do not always correlate with wholesale revenue, and we do not see
a scalable method to address this problem.

3.8 Alexa

We use the Alexa top million domains list to make an estimate of
how often users visit domains in the new TLDs [1]. Alexa collects
their data by allowing browser extensions to include their measure-
ment code in exchange for providing domain analytics, and by al-
lowing Web page operators to do the same. We use a domain’s
presence in the list as an indication that users visit it, but do not
place any emphasis on domain rankings.

3.9 Blacklists

We also compare new domain registrations with URIBL, a pub-
licly available domain blacklist, to see how the blacklist rate com-
pares between old and new TLDs [27]. We use their high-volume
rsync instance to download a new copy of the blacklist every hour.
Though they provide many types of blacklists, we only use the
standard and highest-volume blacklist, labeled “black”, as the rest
tend to be lower volume. This list represents the domains most
likely to be malicious, while the other lists include domains de-
tected through more experimental methodologies.

4. REGISTRATION VOLUME

We ﬁrst look at the impact of the new TLDs on overall registra-
tion volume. The new TLDs represent new opportunities for regis-
tering domains. As registrants create new domains, one possibility
is that they decide to create them in the new TLDs rather than the
old, thereby displacing registration activity in the old TLDs (e.g.,
because names taken in com are available in the new TLDs). An-
other possibility is that the new opportunities motivate even more
registrations, thereby growing total registration activity overall.

Figure 1 shows the number of new domain registrations per week
broken down into various categories. Days for which we did not
have access to the zone ﬁles resulted in slight drops in the graph.

Overall, the introduction of the new TLDs had only minimal im-
pact in the rate of registration of the old TLDs. The new TLDs
generally increase the total number of registrations rather than shift
focus from old to new TLDs. However, the new TLDs see far fewer
registrations than the old TLDs, largely because com continues to
dominate.

5. CONTENT CATEGORIES

As a ﬁrst step towards learning the intent of each domain’s reg-
istrant, we classify the technical data each domain returns when
queried by our DNS or HTTP infrastructure. We perform this clas-
siﬁcation with features of both crawls, including DNS CNAME
records, Web headers, Web contents, and the NS records in the
zone ﬁles.

Domains with invalid DNS or HTTP errors are straightforward
to identify, but in many instances, we need to classify the domains
based on the textual content they return to HTTP queries. We use a
combination of automated machine learning techniques and manual
inspection of Web pages hosted at these domains.

We assign each domain to one of the following seven categories:

No DNS domains do not successfully resolve DNS queries.
HTTP Error domains have valid DNS, but do not return an

HTTP 200 when queried.

Parked domains are owned by an ad network or are for sale
by their owners and typically return Web pages domi-
nated by ads.

Unused domains return HTTP content that is not consumer-
ready, including empty pages, default Web server tem-
plates, or PHP errors.

Free domains include domains given out as part of a pro-
motion that still have the original template, as well as
domains with registry-owned Web templates.

Defensive Redirect domains redirect through one of several

technical mechanisms to a different domain name.

Content domains host valid Web content for users to visit.

We start by presenting high-level content categorizations, includ-
ing domains in the older TLDs as a reference point. Then Sec-
tion 5.2 provides more detail about our clustering methodology,
and Section 5.3 describes the seven categories in more detail.

5.1 Content Summary

To place the new TLD results in context, we present domain clas-
siﬁcations for three data sets. The ﬁrst includes all domains in the
new TLDs as of February 3, 2015. The second includes 3 mil-

lion domains from the old TLDs deﬁned in Section 3.1 chosen uni-
formly at random. The third includes all domains in the same set of
old TLDs that were newly registered during December 2014. (De-
lays in our com processing pipeline prevented us from using a more
recent data set.) Figure 2 summarizes all three data sets. This paper
focuses on the new TLDs, so we focus on those domains. Table 3
shows exact values for the 290 public English TLDs described in
Section 3.3, minus quebec, scot, and gal, the TLDs for which we
did not have zone ﬁle access at the time.

For most categories the classiﬁcation breakdown is comparable
among the three data sets: erroneous domains (No DNS and HTTP
Error) account for about a quarter of all domains, another quarter
utilizes domain parking, and roughly 20% of domains are either
unused or redirect elsewhere. The old and new TLDs differ greatly
in content and promotional domains: the new TLDs show a dearth
of content, but make up for it with a high volume of free domains,
which domain owners do not actively use yet.

Figure 3 shows our content classiﬁcation for the 20 largest TLDs
that allow public registrations. Most TLDs show a typical split
between the major content categories, but other TLDs show very
different registration types, especially those with free domains.

5.2 Content Clustering

Our goal is to cluster Web pages hosted at domains into one of
the content categories. Two key challenges to classifying content
are the sheer size of the data (millions of domains), and the lack of
labeled data for training a classiﬁer. With so many unlabeled Web
pages, we must learn from scratch to classify the domains.

Our ﬁrst step is to cluster Web pages with highly similar content.
This procedure groups together duplicate and near-duplicate Web
pages, which commonly arise when HTML is automatically gen-
erated using a ﬁxed template. Prevalent examples include parked
pages, and default placeholder pages served by a registrar before
the registrant publishes any content.

To map Web pages to inputs for a clustering algorithm, we fol-
low a conventional “bag-of-words” approach which extracts HTML
features from the Web pages.
In particular, we compose a dic-
tionary of all terms that appear in the HTML source code, and
for each Web page, we count the number of times that each term
appears.
In this way, each Web page is represented as a sparse,
high-dimensional vector of feature counts. We implemented a cus-
tom bag-of-words feature extractor which forms tag-attribute-value
triplets from HTML tags, as described in [7].

For reasons of computability and conciseness of results, we be-
gin by clustering roughly one tenth of the crawled Web pages. We
used the k-means clustering algorithm with k = 400 to organize
these Web pages into groups of high similarity (based on the Eu-
clidean distance between their feature vectors). We set k to be in-

most common. We have sorted TLDs by fraction of “No DNS” to
better highlight the category breakdowns of successful content.

tentionally large because we wished to discover especially cohesive
clusters of replicated Web pages.

Next we manually inspected the resulting clusters using a custom
visualization tool. The tool displays screenshots of how the Web
pages rendered in our crawler and provides a link to the HTML
source next to each screenshot. To facilitate efﬁcient manual re-
view, the tool presents a condensed view of the clusters by show-
ing only a sample of Web pages in each one. Speciﬁcally, it sorts
the Web pages in each cluster by their distance to the cluster cen-
troid, then displays the top and bottom-ranked pages as well as a
random sample of pages in between. If all Web pages in this sam-
ple are visually nearly identical, we can conclude with conﬁdence
that the entirety of Web pages in the cluster have been appropri-
ately grouped. Furthermore, we can classify Web pages in these
perfectly homogenous clusters all together.

By examining the clusters, we placed domains into three broad
categories according to their content: parked, content-free, and
meaningful content. Our clustering approach was particularly ef-
fective at identifying large numbers of parked domains and content-
free (or unused) domains that host a default registration page. The
class of Web pages with meaningful content exhibits the most va-
riety: Web content is highly diverse and unlikely to have the same
degree of replication as the other two classes. Thus at this stage,
we focused only on bulk labeling of clusters that clearly contained
parked or content-free Web pages. If it was not visually obvious
how to label a cluster in bulk, then its pages remained unclassiﬁed
at this point. (In practice, though, we found that Web pages with
content often were grouped together in clusters with wide diame-
ters.)

After this phase of clustering, manual inspection, and labeling,
we then aimed to classify domains that were not included in the
initial subset. Now equipped with a large number of labeled exam-
ples, we used nearest neighbor classiﬁcation to discover many more
candidate Web pages which are likely parked or content-free. First,
we extracted HTML features from the remaining Web pages, then
mapped the pages into the same feature space as the original subset.

386Then for each unlabeled Web page, we found its nearest neighbor
by Euclidean distance in the labeled set and, if the distance was less
than a strict threshold, we marked the page as a candidate for its
neighbor’s class. This thresholding minimizes false positives. This
step continues to focus only on parked and content-free pages; no
content pages were classiﬁed in this way. We modiﬁed our visual-
ization tool to display candidates next to their nearest neighbor; if
the Web pages were visually nearly the same, then we were conﬁ-
dent in assigning the appropriate label to the candidates.

In one round of this nearest neighbor method, we were able to
label many of the remaining (non-content) Web pages in our data
set with high conﬁdence. However, since we only clustered about
one tenth of the Web pages at the outset, we likely missed differ-
ent templates that did not appear in the initial subset. Thus, we
iterated this approach to achieve greater coverage. That is, we clus-
tered the remaining unlabeled Web pages, manually inspected and
labeled homogenous clusters, and performed thresholded nearest
neighbor classiﬁcation—now with a larger set of labeled examples.
We iterated this process until there were no more obviously cohe-
sive clusters. Finally, after identifying all parked and content-free
domains, we manually inspected a random sample of the remaining
unlabeled Web pages. The results gave us conﬁdence to conclude
that the remaining Web pages contain legitimate content.

5.3 Content Categories

We use this content clustering methodology to create a cluster
label for each domain. Then, we took any page metadata (e.g., DNS
errors, HTTP status code, the redirect chain, etc.) and combined
these features together to make a ﬁnal classiﬁcation.

The rest of this subsection describes how we combined those fea-
tures to determine a ﬁnal content category. For domains that might
fall into multiple categories, we prioritize categories in the order
listed in Table 3. For example, for parked domains that redirect to
a different domain, usually as part of the parking program, we only
classify as “Parked” and not “Defensive Redirect”.

5.3.1 No DNS

Registrants purchase domain names from a registrar and pay a
yearly fee to keep them, yet a large fraction of domains in the
new gTLDs do not even resolve. Some of these registrants asso-
ciate name server information with their domains, but these servers
do not respond to DNS queries, or only respond with the DNS
REFUSED error code. For instance, adsense.xyz has an NS record
for ns1.google.com, but its name server returns REFUSED for all
queries (which recursive resolvers usually report as SERVFAIL to
the end user). Out of 3,638,209 domains in the new TLDs, we had
567,390 DNS failures with an associated NS record, or 15.6%.

Other registrants buy domains and then do not associate name
server information with them. Since the zone ﬁles only contain
associations between domain names and name servers, they contain
no entries for this set of domains. We do not have a list of these
domain names and do not have a clear mechanism to ﬁnd them.

While we cannot enumerate these domains, we can infer their
presence through the ICANN monthly reports. The monthly re-
ports provide a summary of domain activity and transactions for all
registered domains (i.e., domains with a yearly fee). We can use the
difference between the number of domains in the ICANN reports
and the number of domains in the zone ﬁle as an estimate for the
number of domains with no name server information.

Our analysis shows that out of 3,754,141 total domains in the
reports, 207,184 domains (5.5%) do not appear in their respective
zone ﬁles. Registrants pay for these domains like any other, but
they do not resolve.

Table 4: Breakdown of HTTP errors encountered when visiting
Web pages.

5.3.2 HTTP Error

We next classify domains that resolve to an IP address, but return
no result or an HTTP error code when queried on port 80. We
suspect some of these error conditions are temporary. Others are
likely longer-term misconﬁgurations by owners who do not care
about the content hosted on the domains, making them likely brand
defenders. Alternatively, these domains might serve a legitimate
purpose that is motivated by content other than Web. Because we
use the status code from the ﬁnal landing page, even HTTP 3xx
status codes indicate errors, typically a redirect loop.

We received 362,727 responses to that we classiﬁed as HTTP
errors. Table 4 provides a breakdown. Notably, most domains in
this category exhibit connection issues such as timeouts or return
HTTP 5xx return codes, meant for internal server issues. The vari-
ety of errors is multifarious: overall we received responses with 43
unique HTTP status codes.2

5.3.3 Parked

Many domain registrants do not have a plan to monetize the con-
tent of their domain names. Most of them are speculating on the
name itself, intending to sell it later for a proﬁt. Some may have a
plan to develop the site later in its lifetime, but have not put up any
content yet. Still other owners initially created Web properties that
turned out to be unsuccessful, and later parked them while waiting
for expiration. Whatever the reason, domain parking is common in
all TLDs. We discovered 1,161,892 parked domains in our data set,
or 31.9% of all domains in the zone ﬁles.

Potential domain speculators have the choice of a large number
of parking services. Some parking services also act as domain reg-
istrars (e.g., GoDaddy and Sedo), while others focus solely on park-
ing. Registrants use their services by setting their name server (NS)
record to the parking service’s DNS servers, redirecting their Web
trafﬁc to the parking service, or setting a CNAME. Parking services
that also act as registrars may or may not use different name servers
for parked domains compared to normal registrations.

Parked domains come in two main varieties [3]. Most domain
parking monetization is through pay per click (PPC) advertising.
These parked pages look much like search result pages with links
pertaining to words in the domain name. Each link on this page
is an advertisement. Other parked domains use pay per redirect
(PPR). When the target domain’s owner purchases “direct naviga-
tion trafﬁc” from an ad network used by the parking program, the
parking service will redirect the user to a page run by an ad pur-
chaser. Decisions to serve PPC or PPR to any particular visitor
happen in real time based on characteristics provided by the traf-
ﬁc purchaser, including domain keywords or trafﬁc from limited
geographic regions.

2Six domains responded with the HTTP response code 418, an er-
ror code added as part of the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Proto-
col in a satirical RFC [13]. The return code means “I’m a teapot”.

Table 5: Our capture methods for parking and how many domains
each catches. We identify most parking domains with more than
one classiﬁer; column 2 shows how many domains each classiﬁer
identiﬁes, while the last column shows how many are unique to
that classiﬁer.

Table 6: The mechanisms domain owners use to redirect to a
different domain. Most domain owners use only browser-level
redirects, but frames are still very common. Very few content
domains use multiple redirect methods.

As a starting point, two previous studies also needed to classify
parked domains as part of their work. Alrwais et al. focus on how
parking programs operate, and use domains from known parking
name servers as their source [3]. Vissers et al. focus on classifying
parked domains, but use parking pages from known parking name
servers as their inputs [28]. However, our problem is slightly dif-
ferent since we want to identify random pages from the Internet
as parked or not. Some parking programs host both legitimate and
parked pages using the same name servers, including one of the
largest parking services, GoDaddy. We need a different approach
to identifying parking than either of these papers suggest.

We identify parked domains with three mechanisms. First, we
use our k-means content classiﬁer to identify PPC parking services.
Often there are many of these pages for each parking service, with
variations only in the displayed links; all layout and remote re-
sources remain constant for any given parking service. As such,
they tend to cluster well and are easy to identify with this method.
Second, we use the visit’s full redirect chain, acquired with the
methodology described in Section 5.3.6, to identify PPR parking.
These domains usually redirect through an ad network before land-
ing at their ﬁnal destination for accounting purposes. We manually
inspected redirect chains for visits to known parking name servers
to compile a set of URL features that indicate parking. For in-
stance, if any URL contains “zeroredirect1.com” or both “domain”
and “sale”, we classify the domain as parked.

Finally, we use known parking name servers, such as those for
sedoparking.com. We use this method only for servers we are
conﬁdent host solely parked domains. We start by taking the inter-
section of the different sets used by Alrwais et al. [3] and Vissers
et al. [28]; the intersection includes all but one of the name servers
from the latter set. For each name server in the set intersection, we
use our k-means classiﬁer to determine if domains using that name
server are parked or not. For those we did not identify as park-
ing (a very small set), we manually inspect a random selection of
screenshots and their redirect chains. If we believe them all to be
parking trafﬁc missed by our classiﬁer, then we assume all domains
using the name server are parked. With this additional veriﬁcation
step, we concluded with high conﬁdence that all 14 name servers
in our set are used strictly for domain parking. Finally, we added
one additional name server (parklogic.com) to our set, which we
found to be dedicated to parking services through our classiﬁcation
experiments.

Table 5 shows how many parked domains we identify with each
method. We identify most parking domains with more than one of
our three methods. In particular, we identify all but 124 of nearly
280,000 domains on our set of parking name servers with another
approach. This high detection accuracy provides validation of our
other parking classiﬁers, and further increases our conﬁdence that
we have identiﬁed the prevalent parking behaviors.

5.3.4 Unused

In our analysis, we ﬁnd many Web pages that ﬁt in none of the
above categories, but also do not provide meaningful content. Most
of these are placeholder pages served by a large registry with in-
structions for the owner on how to develop their domain. Others
are empty Web pages, or the default template provided by a soft-
ware package. Whatever the reason, these pages do not provide
meaningful content to end users and we refer to them as “Unused”.
Unused pages often appear in bulk, so we identify them using our
k-means classiﬁer. With this technique, we ﬁnd 504,928 content-
free domains in our data set, or 13.9% of domains in the new TLDs.

5.3.5 Free

Domains we identify as part of a promotion, such as those de-
scribed in Section 2.3, get their own content classiﬁcation. Most of
these domains fall into the “Unused” category through a strict cate-
gorization, but the registrant plays a different role for these (which
will be relevant when determining intent in Section 6).

Though not part of a promotion, the property TLD largely con-
tains domains owned by Uniregistry, its registry. The TLD showed
slow growth in all other time periods, but on February 1, 2015 it
grew from 2,472 to 38,464 domains in a single day. Uniregistry
owns all of these domains and hosts a standard sale page with the
text “Make this name yours.” We place these registry-owned con-
tent placeholders into the “Free” category as well.3 In total, we ﬁnd
432,323 free domains in the new TLD program (11.9%).

5.3.6 Defensive Redirects

Many domains in the new gTLDs have at least one redirect,
and most of these point to a different domain. The role of the
redirect depends on the type of content. Some parking programs
redirect from the initial domain to a standard parking page, using
the URL parameters to pass a domain identiﬁer for revenue shar-
ing purposes. Defensive registrations often redirect to the owner’s
other domain names, typically in an older TLD. We check for three
kinds of redirects: CNAMEs, browser-level redirects, and single
large frames. Table 6 shows how many domains redirect with each
mechanism.

A CNAME is a DNS record type that acts like a symbolic link
between two domains. Any DNS query that results in a CNAME
causes the resolver to perform the same query on the target. Some-
times the result is another CNAME, which our DNS crawler must
follow before ﬁnally resulting in an answer to the original query.
Most domains with a CNAME only have a single CNAME, but
chains of up to four are not uncommon in CDNs. For example, in
our February 3 data set, the domain tangyao.xyz has a CNAME
to scwcty.gotoip2.com. This domain has its own CNAME to
hkvhost660.800cdn.com.

3We do not classify them as “Parking” because they do not show
ads and they are owned by the registry.

Table 7: Which locations our visits were ultimately redirected
towards.

Browser-level redirects happen when DNS resolves to a host
running an HTTP server, but a query to that server returns a redi-
rect which our browser will follow automatically. For example, an
HTTP request to tucsonphotobooth.com returns an HTTP 302
redirect to bumblebeephotobooth.com, which modern browsers
obey without user interaction. A domain owner can do this in a
very large number of ways, such as with a 300–399 status code, an
HTTP header, an HTML meta tag, or using JavaScript to set win-
dow.location. We ﬁnd and store these redirects at crawl time, so we
are robust to these and less common methods.

In practice, we ﬁnd many pages that return valid HTML, do not
redirect, and present only a single large frame to the end user, such
that all visual content comes through the frame. Although it does
not use an explicit redirection mechanism, this technique provides
the same effect: a user visits one domain on their browser, and sees
content from another. Since these frames serve the same purpose as
a CNAME or an HTTP redirect, we consider these to be redirects
as well.

To determine if a page contains only a single large frame, we ﬁrst
check how many frames the page contains. We do this in JavaScript
in the browser, so we do not need to use textual analysis to ﬁnd
them. The remaining challenge is to differentiate between pages
with a single large frame, and pages with real content that have a
smaller frame, such as for page navigation or tracking purposes.

We differentiate between these classes using the DOM. First, we
remove non-visible components from the page, as well as anything
having to do with the frame itself: the head tag, frameset and
iframe tags, and long URLs. These modiﬁcations are safe because
we operate on the DOM, not the original HTML, so non-visible
components that transform visual components (such as JavaScript)
have already run. By examining the string length of the resulting
DOM, the pages we crawl fall cleanly into two classes. Altogether,
49% of the ﬁltered DOMs have a string length of less than 55 char-
acters, but show variable behavior based on the few remaining tags.
The remaining pages distribute mostly evenly with a few spikes
corresponding to common page templates. A visual examination
of the pages in these clusters shows that the short pages do show
only a single large frame, while most of the large pages have other
visual content.

The most important two pieces of the overall redirect chain are
the starting domain and the ﬁnal page that serves content. To deter-
mine the last, we check for a single large frame ﬁrst, then a browser-
level redirect, and ﬁnally a CNAME. A domain with all three be-
haviors serves its real content through the frame; the CNAME and
browser-level redirects only point to the next resource. We classify
redirects by the domain they point to: same-domain, same-TLD,
“com”, new-TLD, old-TLD, or IP.

Table 7 shows which of these six location types domains in the
new TLDs tend to point towards. Though each of these domains
has some form of redirect when fetching Web content, redirects to a
page under the same domain name are less interesting because they
reﬂect aspects of the structure of the Web page itself. Similarly, we
cannot make any strong claims about redirects to a hard-coded IP
address.

Instead, we only consider redirects to a different domain to fall
into our redirect category. We do include redirects to other domains
within the same TLD because in this case, the registrant is only us-
ing the destination domain for primary purposes. We ﬁnd 236,380
off-domain redirects in our data set, or 6.5% of all domains in the
new TLD zone ﬁles. 94.5% of defensive redirects point to domains
in the old TLDs, with over half of those to com. In short, defen-
sive redirects are only a small fraction of the overall registration
behavior in the new TLDs.

5.3.7 Content

We classify domains under “Content” when they do not ﬁt into
another of our content classiﬁcations. The other aspects of our cat-
egorization pull out common errors, interesting features like redi-
rects, and Web responses that appear frequently. Domains that do
not ﬁt into any of those categories resolve in the DNS, return HTTP
200 status codes, and provide vaguely unique responses to Web
queries. Only 372,569 domains (10.2%) fall into this category. By
comparing this category with the previous, we ﬁnd that 38.8% of
the 608,949 domains with real content redirect to a different do-
main to serve it.

6. REGISTRATION INTENT

In the previous section, we focused on understanding the types
of content that domains in the new gTLDs host. In this section we
explore the high-level intent of the domain’s registrant. For each
domain, we infer what motivated its registrant to spend money on
the name. We classify registration intent into one of three broad
categories:

Defensive registrants purchased a new domain to defend an

existing Web presence.

Primary registrants own domains with the intent to estab-

lish a Web presence.

Speculative registrants intend to proﬁt off of the name itself
and never plan to develop a meaningful Web presence.

Before classifying domains by registration intent into one of the
above categories, we must remove some types of domains. We ig-
nore domains in the “Unused” and “HTTP Error” categories. We
could guess that these domains tend to include more defensive than
primary motivations since they are not user-ready and therefore the
use of the name is the only relevant effect on the Internet. How-
ever, registrants likely buy domains they intend to develop all the
time, and these domain names may transition to other categoriza-
tions given time or result in expirations.

We also ignore domains in the “Free” content category before
deciding registration intent. In a typical domain registration sce-
nario, we know registrants have expressed genuine interest in the
domains they own because they paid money for them. Without ig-
noring the “Free” content category, we could not use the results of
our registrant intent classiﬁcations to make any claims about why
registrants purchase domain names.

Table 8 summarizes our results. In the following sections, we de-
scribe each registration intent category in more detail. We discuss
what types of registrants we expect each category to cover and how
we map content categories to registration intents for each domain.

6.1 Defensive

Our defensive registration intent set begins with domains that
redirect to a different domain name. Some off-domain redirects
could reﬂect primary registrations: registrants could use their old
name for technical or historical reasons but primarily use and mar-
ket the new domain name. However, we ﬁnd in practice that most
are defensive, and many lead to sites whose branding and headers
clearly advertise the landing domain.4

Additionally, we include domains that return invalid DNS results
in this set. Owners of non-resolving domains could only use their
names for private purposes, since trafﬁc routed through the public
Internet cannot correctly address a remote server. A more likely
explanation is that the registrant only cares about the name. We in-
clude domains with invalid NS records as well as those that do not
appear in the zone ﬁle (both described in Section 5.3.1), for a to-
tal of 774,574 non-resolving domains. Combined with the 236,380
defensive redirects, we ﬁnd defensive registrations of 1,010,954 do-
mains in the new TLDs.

6.2 Primary

Primary domains include all those purchased by a registrant with
the intent to use that speciﬁc domain. Most primary registrants pur-
chased their domain to establish a Web presence, but there are other
kinds of primary registrants as well. We only classify domains in
our “Content” category as primary registrations. Each of these do-
mains resolves and could conceivably host content intended for end
users. Our clustering technique did not ﬁnd similar Web content for
these domains, so registrants of those domains at a minimum host
sufﬁciently unique content.

6.3 Speculative

Many registrants purchase domains to speculate on the domain
itself with no intent to develop content. Most make use of the ﬁrst-
come ﬁrst-served nature of domain registrations to grab domains
they believe others will ﬁnd desirable in the hope of selling them
later for a proﬁt. Others host parking-based advertising and pay-
per-redirect services with the goal of monetizing through ad rev-
enue, but still with no intent to develop unique content. In practice,
most speculators in the ﬁrst case also host parked content because
it is essentially free (and often bundled with domain registration
fees), and also serves as a signal to prospective buyers that the name
is available.

From a content standpoint, the difference between a defensive
and speculative registration is relatively narrow. Defensive regis-
trants purchase domains to defend the string but with no intent to
develop content, while speculative registrants purchase domains to
resell later with no intent to develop content. However, speculative
registrants are monetarily motivated on a per-domain margin, while
defensive registrants have revenues outside the domain business. A

4Trademark holders make defensive registrations on their own
brands. The same registration made by a different actor with mali-
cious intent would instead qualify as cybersquatting.

TLDs. The vertical line at $185,000 USD corresponds to the
minimum ICANN application fee, and the line at $500,000 USD
corresponds to a more realistic estimate of the cost of establishing
a new TLD.

speculator must monetize the name, but a defender does not. There-
fore, we classify parked domains as speculative and non-resolving
domains as defensive based on this distinction.

7. REGISTRATION COSTS

Previously, we focused on the new TLD system from a registrant-
centric perspective. In this section we look at the new TLD rollout
from the point of view of the registries. We examine how registries
make money and how they interact with registrars in practice.

7.1 Registry Financials

Using the methodology described in Section 3.7, we obtained
pricing information for 2,006 (TLD, registrar) pairs, which account
for 73.8% of all domain registrations. In only four TLDs do we
record prices from fewer than three registrars; in each case, how-
ever, the one or two registrars we do record account for at least
97.5% of all domains. In the remaining 26.2% of domain registra-
tions for which we do not have matching data, we use the median
price for the TLD.

Figure 4 shows a complementary cumulative distribution func-
tion of the cost to registrants per TLD. A point on the line shows
the ratio of new TLDs that have made at least the correspond-
ing amount in registration costs. We included a vertical line at
$185,000 USD, the standard application fee for a new TLD [19].
At this cost, roughly half of all TLDs made this money back. We
estimate the total cost to registrants for domains in the new TLDs
at $89 million USD through March 2015.

The application fee, however, only represents a lower bound on
the amount each registry spent on their TLD. Additional costs to
ICANN include a quarterly $6,250 fee [5], a per-domain transac-
tion fee for registries with more than 50,000 transactions per year (a
threshold only 18 TLDs have met), and additional application fees
for TLDs that must enter the contention process. While registries
do not have many other explicit costs, the TLD application process
ran for years before the ﬁrst delegation; presumably registries built
up legal or personnel costs in the meantime. Registries also need to
connect with registrars, market and brand their TLDs, build a Web
presence, and run or outsource technical operations.

As a result, we also include 500,000 USD as a more realistic esti-
mate for the cost of establishing a new TLD. While it is conjecture,
some TLDs have already gone up for auction, like reise [23] and

versicherung [4], which set reserve prices of 400,000 USD and
750,000 USD, respectively. Given the small number of registra-
tions each had at the time, these TLDs were valuable because they
had completed the delegation process, suggesting the sale price
roughly reﬂects the cost of delegation. With these reserve prices,
we chose 500,000 USD as a rounded estimate in this range. At this
estimate, only about 10% of TLDs are proﬁtable.

Revenue from domain registrations does not all go to the registry.
Instead, registries and registrars split revenue based on a previously
agreed upon model. For instance, Verisign makes $7.85 USD per
com registration [6] and $6.79 per net registration [18]. During our
pricing data collection, we found registration prices for both com
and net names ranging from $8 to $13 USD, or markups ranging
from $0.15 to $6.5

Unfortunately, the new registry agreements do not specify max-
imum wholesale prices, only fees the registry must pay to ICANN.
For calibration, we can get a handful of prices through registry-
reported earning data. Rightside, one of the largest back-end reg-
istry providers, is funded through private investors and has released
some revenue statistics online in a presentation meant for investors
and analysts [25]. They provide end-of-November wholesale and
total revenue numbers for ﬁve TLDs, two of them aggregated. Our
estimate is too low for reviews,6 but our other estimates over-
estimate the wholesale price by close to a factor of 1.4. Our model
does not factor in premium domain name sales, a non-trivial rev-
enue source that does not correlate well with wholesale price. As
a result, Figure 4 represents a low estimate of domain name costs,
and we discuss the limitations of our model further in Section 7.4.

7.2 Renewal Rates

All registries in the new gTLD program anticipated the one year
and 45 day mark since the introduction of the earliest TLDs [2].7
This milestone provides the ﬁrst chance for registrants in the new
TLDs to renew their domain names, and hence reﬂects ongoing de-

5Registries can offer “bulk discounts and marketing support and in-
centive programs” but must offer similar terms to all registrars [6].
6The price we found for reviews domains through two registrars
owned by the same company as Rightside is less than its wholesale
price. We found pricing for November through archive.org [17]
and found that the price to registrants of a review domain has
halved. We do not know if this reﬂects a reduction in its whole-
sale price or a promotion.
7The extra 45 days is for the Auto-Renew Grace Period, which al-
lows registrars to keep the registrations for free. Usually the regis-
trar uses this time to offer the registrant one last chance for renewal,
in case they let it expire accidentally.

mand for domains in the new TLDs after one year’s actual, rather
than anticipated, experience with the domains. Donuts, the largest
registry with over a hundred new TLDs, published statistics on re-
newal rates for their earliest TLDs [10, 24], likely in an attempt to
attract registrars and investors [30]. However, Donuts limited their
analysis to their own TLDs, and also did not provide numbers past
26 days.

Figure 5 shows a histogram of renewal rates by TLD. We only
performed our analysis on TLDs where at least a hundred domains
completed a full year of registrations plus the 45-day Auto-Renew
Grace Period. The Donuts TLDs in our data set show renewal rates
within a few percentage points of the numbers Donuts reported in
April. We calculate an overall renewal rate of 71%.

7.3 Future Proﬁt Modeling

In this section, we take a look at registry proﬁtability using a va-
riety of parameters. In face of the limitations of our proﬁt model-
ing discussed in Section 7.4, we acknowledge that drawing higher-
order conclusions from such limited data could lead to models that
are incorrect in unpredictable ways. However, we would still like to
attempt to classify “successful” TLDs, and proﬁtability is a strong
indicator of the success of any company.

We start by graphing TLD proﬁtability over time under four dif-
ferent models in Figure 6. A point on a line indicates the fraction
of TLDs that were proﬁtable within the given time since general
availability. We show four curves that reﬂect different values for
two parameters. Two of the models assume an initial cost to the
registry of only 185,000 USD, or the amount of the ICANN ap-
plication fee. This is the minimum amount we know all registries
must pay. The other models assume an initial cost of 500,000 USD,
which better reﬂects our understanding of the cost of creating a reg-
istry. The second parameter is renewal rates. We show models with
renewal rates of 57% and 79%, which reﬂect lower and higher than
average rates and show the sensitivity of the model to renewals.

For each TLD, we collect registration volume data from the re-
ports provided via ICANN. We consider TLDs for which we have
three monthly reports after general availability. The ﬁrst month
typically contains a burst of registrations, and then the second and
third provide two data points at a more typical registration rate. We
model future months based on new registrations at this rate, and
renewals of domains registered or renewed 12 months prior at the
indicated renewal rate. We estimate the wholesale price as 70% of
the total price at the cheapest registrar.

Figure 7: Modeling proﬁtability by type of TLD. The gray line
represents the aggregate, and the colored lines represent the set of
TLDs of the indicated type.

Figure 8: Modeling proﬁtability by registry for the registries with
the most TLDs. The gray line represents the aggregate, with
colored lines representing individual registries.

Figure 6 shows that the initial cost plays a much larger role than
the renewal rate in the short term, but that both parameters are im-
portant in the long term. We ﬁnd that even under the most per-
missive model, with high renewal rates and no fees beyond those
imposed by ICANN, 10% of TLDs still do not become proﬁtable
within the ﬁrst 10 years.

Since there are a wide variety of registries operating new TLDs,
and there is a wide variety of domain registration activity across the
TLDs, we were interested to see if there were features that might
separate proﬁtable and unproﬁtable TLDs. To that end, we com-
pared proﬁtability based on four metrics:

❖ lexical string length;
❖ the registry for TLDs belonging to the top four

registries, otherwise “Other”;

❖ the type of registry (“generic”, “community”, or

“geographic”); and

❖ whether or not the most common registrars all sell

domains in the TLD.

In practice, we only found minor variations in proﬁtability based
on these metrics. We present results for the most signiﬁcant differ-
entiators, type and registry, below.

Figure 7 shows variations in proﬁtability by type of TLD. The
gray line represents the overall proﬁtability CDF. It is equivalent to
the proﬁtability CDFs in Figure 6 with an initial cost of 500,000
USD and an overall renewal rate of 71%. The remaining lines rep-
resent non-overlapping TLD subsets which combine to the same
overall set. Though community and geographical TLDs become
proﬁtable much sooner than generic TLDs, there are so few of them
in comparison that the proﬁtability of generic TLDs still closely
tracks the overall rate.

Similarly, Figure 8 shows variations in proﬁtability by registry.
Of the large registries, only Uniregistry TLDs become proﬁtable
sooner than the average. Instead, our data suggests owners of mul-
tiple TLDs mainly beneﬁt by spreading the risk. Many registries
only manage between one and three TLDs, and those strings tend
to become proﬁtable sooner than most of the large registries.

7.4 Limitations

We see proﬁtability as an important metric with which to com-
pare registries, but our methodology has some limitations. In this
section, we describe the known limitations and their expected im-
pact on the results.

First, our pricing model does not include premium domain name
sales, as described in Section 3.7. For the few TLDs for which
we have seen premium domain revenue reports, these sales vary
considerably. For different TLDs, we have seen the total revenue
from premium domain sales range from $0 to the same amount as
the total revenue of wholesale domains.
It is also plausible that
some TLDs could get more total revenue from premium domain
names than from standard registrations. As a result, this category
represents the largest unknown in our model. Premium domain
names renew for the normal registration cost, so this unknown only
affects the initial upfront purchase of the name and not ongoing
renewal revenue.

Second, for any given TLD/registrar pair, we only record a sin-
gle price, when domain name prices could change over time. To
date we ﬁnd that, after the beginning of general availability, domain
prices do not change very frequently. Future studies could address
this assumption by periodically regathering pricing data. For prac-
tical reasons, doing so would require deploying a more automated
method of gathering prices than we used in this paper.

Finally, we estimate wholesale prices as 70% of the lowest price
for domains in the TLD. We leave a better estimation of this price
to future work.

8. VISITS

As an alternative to our registrant-focused analysis, we also an-
alyze the new TLD program from an end user perspective. In par-
ticular, we want to know whether actual users visit domains in the
new TLDs, and how that compares to similar domains in the old
TLDs. We use a domain’s presence or absence in the Alexa top
million domains as a metric for whether or not users visit it. We do
not consider the ranking order as we only care whether or not the
domain gets trafﬁc at all.

We begin by splitting new domain registrations from December
2014 into two sets, one for domains in the new TLDs and one for
domains in the old TLDs. We ﬁnd 326,974 registrations in Decem-
ber 2014 in the new TLDs, and 3,461,322 in the old TLDs. We
compare these sets with the Alexa top million from April 13, 2014.
We use a newer Alexa list to allow the new domain registrations
time to develop their Web presence. Due to the order of magnitude
size difference between our new registration sets, we report results
per hundred thousand new registrations.

Table 9: The rate at which new domains in the old and new TLDs
appear in blacklists and Alexa. This table only includes domains
registered within the same one-month time window to compare
old and young TLDs on equal terms.

Table 9 summarizes our results. New domain registrations in the
old TLDs are nearly three times more likely to appear in the Alexa
top million when compared to registrations in the new TLDs. This
ratio is also consistent with appearances on the Alexa top ten thou-
sand. While this is a notable difference, it is also consistent with
the proportion of primary registrations described in Section 5.1.

We use a similar method with the URIBL blacklist as an indica-
tor of abusive behavior. We use the same sets of newly registered
domains. We use a blacklist contemporaneous with our registra-
tion data because blacklist operators add abusive domains as soon
as possible. Table 9 summarizes our results.

We ﬁnd that domains in new TLDs are twice as likely to appear
on the URIBL blacklist within the ﬁrst month. Our data does not
reveal why spammers ﬁnd the new TLDs attractive. However, we
can guess based on the registrar pricing data we collected as de-
scribed in Section 3.7. Domains in new TLDs tended to cost more
on average, but individual registrars sometimes sold them for sig-
niﬁcantly reduced prices. In the extreme we found xyz domains
for less than $1 USD per year at some registrars.

Table 10 shows the ten TLDs for which a new registration is
most likely to appear on a blacklist. Domains registered in Decem-
ber 2014 in most TLDs had less than a 1% chance of appearing on
a blacklist in the same month, but the link, red, and rocks TLDs
showed signiﬁcantly higher rates of blacklisting. We found link
domains for as cheap as $1.50 USD, but rocks domains cost at
least $7.99 USD. The characteristics of these domains that consis-
tently contribute towards higher rates of abusive behavior remains
an open question.

9. CONCLUSION

ICANN greatly expanded the TLD name space to increase con-
sumer choice and to allow more domain registrants to get short and
memorable domain names. As we have found in previous TLD
expansions [11, 12], new TLDs can increase primary domain regis-
trations but can also lead to speculation and defensive registrations.
ICANN’s new rapid expansion of the available TLDs gives primary
registrants a lot more choice, but also increases the demands on de-
fensive registrants seeking to protect their marks.

We take a comprehensive approach to understanding how regis-
trants use domain names in ICANN’s new TLD program. We used
data from many sources, including zone ﬁle data available to re-
searchers, extensive crawls of Web and DNS information, and pub-
lic data from ICANN, registries and registrars. We determined that
only 15% of domains purchased by a registrant show behavior con-
sistent with primary registrations and that domain parking drives
over 30% of registrations in the new gTLD zone ﬁles. We use do-
main pricing information to estimate that only half of all registries
have recouped their application fee in wholesale revenue. Simi-
larly, we conservatively estimate that registrants have spent roughly
$89 million USD on domain registrations in the new TLDs. Finally,

we validate the expectation that users visit fewer new domains in
new gTLDs than those in old, and that new domains are more than
twice as likely to appear on a commonly available blacklist within
the ﬁrst month of registration. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest
that new gTLDs, while accruing signiﬁcant revenue for registrars,
have yet to provide value to the Internet community in the same
way as legacy TLDs.
