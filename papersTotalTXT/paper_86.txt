Abstract. This work addresses fundamental questions about the nature of cy-
bercriminal organization. We investigate the organization of three underground
forums: BlackhatWorld, Carders and L33tCrew to understand the nature of dis-
tinct communities within a forum, the structure of organization and the impact
of enforcement, in particular banning members, on the structure of these forums.
We ﬁnd that each forum is divided into separate competing communities. Smaller
communities are limited to 100-230 members, have a two-tiered hierarchy akin
to a gang, and focus on a subset of cybercrime activities. Larger communities
may have thousands of members and a complex organization with a distributed
multi-tiered hierarchy more akin to a mob; such communities also have a more
diverse cybercrime portfolio compared to smaller cohorts. Finally, despite differ-
ences in size and cybercrime portfolios, members on a single forum have similar
operational practices, for example, they use the same electronic currency.

Introduction

The notion of what it means to be ‘organized’ is contentious, even in traditional crime [12].
Cybercrime complicates this debate through underground forums, where the coopera-
tion can be described both as (vertically integrated) ﬁrms [20] and cybercrime com-
mons [2]. Understanding the organization of such criminal networks, however, can help
distinguish important actors on these forums, the economic efﬁciency of enforcement,
and the comparative impact of distinct enforcement strategies [21, 28, 32].

Research in economics of security establishes the incentives for cybercriminals to
organize (e.g. specialization [13]), the cost to cooperation (e.g. ripper tax [15]), and
cybercriminals’ response in managing trust (e.g. banning misbehaving members [2,
32]). However, it does not examine the resulting nature of cybercriminal organizations
as shaped by these distinct and often conﬂicting forces, e.g. preferential attachment [30]
This paper addresses three questions about the nature of cybercriminal organization
on underground forums. First, is a single underground forum comprised of distinct cy-
bercriminal communities? If so what are the similarities and differences across commu-
nities, speciﬁcally in terms of topics of communication between participants? Second,
we compute and correlate various measures of centrality (or importance) for individ-
ual cybercriminals on a single underground forum. Centrally located cybercriminals
may receive more responses to public posts [26], be more trusted by their peers [23],
have access to more quality information [7], need fewer overall transactions and thus
lower associated costs [25], and enjoy leadership positions [5]. Finally, we investigate
the impact of community (rule) enforcement on underground forums. Speciﬁcally, we

examine the impact of banning members on social networks metrics that are associated
with sustainable trust management in cybercriminal online forums [2]. We make four
contributions:

1. We show that there are distinct sub-communities of cybercriminals on under-
ground forums. Smaller communities have 100-230 members, similar to the Dun-
bar number, and have a two-tiered hierarchy with centralized control similar to a
gang [6]. Larger communities have ﬂatter hierarchies, distributed control, and mul-
tiple tiers, similar to a mob [6] as well as a more diverse cybercrime portfolio.

2. We note that most communities sub-specialize in speciﬁc crimes. Communities

on a single forum, however, have similar operational practices.

3. We ﬁnd that different measures of centrality correlate on all forums. Some cy-
bercriminals may enjoy disproportional advantage as they may simultaneously be
more popular [26], imbue more trust [23], have access to better and more informa-
tion [7], have lower transaction costs [25], and be considered leaders [5].

4. We observe that banning misbehaving nodes can have a tangible and posi-
tive impact on the structure of the network. When members with higher close-
ness/betweenness centrality are removed the change in small world characteristics
may be greater. Thus, individuals who can propagate information over shorter paths
are better at reducing trust in the network.

2 Background

Previous work observed two kinds of organizations in traditional crime [27]: gangs and
mobs. Gangs have a two-tier hierarchy with a central leader and a group of followers
that adhere to central command; mobs have a more complex command and control
structure and typically specialize in speciﬁc crimes. Ethnographic accounts from the
1980’s noted that cybercriminal organizations lacked characteristics of a mob, as they
do not specialize [22]. While there is incentive for individual market participants to
specialize [24], it is unclear whether the same is true for organized cybercrime entities,
e.g. to leverage comparative advantage [18]. In this paper, we begin to explore the notion
of ‘organization’ in cybercrime as it applies to underground forums. We analyze three
underground forums that were leaked anonymously and were publicly available. Our
study is orthogonal to the previous studies on these forums that provided descriptions
of the forums [26], analyzed cybercrime commons [2] and proposed an algorithm to
identify duplicate identities of pseudonymous cybercriminals [1].

Trust: The main challenge to cybercriminal organization is the lack of trust among
peers [32] and incentive to cheat [15]. D´ecary [7] notes the presence of small com-
munities on IRC chat rooms; he argues that small communities allow each member to
know everyone else, emphasizing the importance of direct ties. Humans, however, may
only have meaningful relationships with up to a 150 people (i.e. the Dunbar number),
with a conﬁdence interval of 100 to 230 [10], even online [9]. We examine whether or
not an underground forum starts to divide into distinct communities as the size of an
underground forum increases beyond the Dunbar number.

The Dunbar number should not necessarily limit cybercriminal membership in a
single community, as it is possible to design mechanisms to scale trust [2]. For exam-
ple, peer-produced ratings allow buyers to evaluate a seller for credibility [26]; forum
members who do not comply with rules, e.g. by creating duplicate accounts, can be
banned. We explore how trust and trust management strategies, e.g. banning members,
shape the organization of cybercriminal networks on underground forums.

Importance of centrality measures: Individual criminals have a higher probability of
pay-off depending on their ability to interpret market signals of quality (of goods, ser-
vices, and individual traders) [8]. Thus, a cybercriminal’s ability to succeed or make
proﬁts may depend on their location in the network, which is measured by centrality.
Examination of Russian malware writers noted that individuals with higher technical
skills were more centrally located [16]; however, Dupont examined a co-offending net-
work of 10 cybercriminals and noted the difference in social popularity and technical
savviness [11]; the most popular criminal did not control the most botnets. From an
enforcement perspective, focusing on degree central criminals is efﬁcient in the former
case but not in the latter. Examining the correlation between various centrality mea-
sures on underground forums would illuminate the structural properties of the market
and thereby inform deterrence measures [29].

3 Analyses

This study investigates the nature of organization in cybercrime as it manifests on under-
ground forums. We analyze three underground forums: BlackhatWorld (BW), Carders
(CC), and L33tCrew (LC) (Table 1).

To analyze the forums, we model the private message interactions of a forum as a
weighted directed graph, G = (V, E), where each node, v ∈ V , is a member of the
forum, each edge, e = A → B, is a non-trivial and non-administrative private message
from member A to member B and weight wAB is the edge weight denotes the number
of messages sent from A to B. We remove the administrative and automated messages
from the private messages. If a member only had administrative messages during his
entire time in the forum, that member is also removed from the network. The resulting
graph is used as the social network of the forum in the following analyses.

3.1 Analysis 1: Identifying communities

Our goal for this study is to see whether or not distinct communities exist within a
forum and compare topics among these communities.

Methodology: The main challenge to cybercriminal organization is lack of trust. Trust
may not scale beyond Dunbar limits; thus, as a forum gets larger it may begin to frag-
ment into distinct communities. To ﬁnd these communities we use the Louvain method
which is a fast heuristic approach based on modularity optimization [4]. Modularity of a
network is the fraction of the edges that fall within the given groups minus the expected
fraction if edges were distributed at random. The range of values for modularity is [-1,
1]. Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within
modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules.

Distinct communities may be similar or different. For example, different communi-
ties may compete for the same cybercrime; alternatively, they may specialize to lever-
age comparative advantage [17]. We use topic modeling to examine whether different
communities specialize. We apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [3] on the private
messages of community members to discover topics of their discussion and rank the
topics based on their occurrence.

Results: The largest forum, L33tCrew, has the smallest number of non-trivial commu-
nities, but most of the communities on L33tCrew are larger than the other two forums
(Table 3). The size of the communities on BlackhatWorld is smaller than Carders and
L33tCrew and the communities are well separated (high modularity score) compared to
that of the other forums (Table 2). We suspect this is because BlackhatWorld was less
mature than the other two forums when the data was collected. Every forum has some
common topics, usually the payment method or method of communication (Table 4).
For example, the members of Carders use ukash/Paysafecard whereas on Blackhat-
World members use paypal. On L33tCrew the most common media for communication
are ICQ/Jabber, but on BlackhatWorld members use Aim, Yahoo! and MSN instant
messaging services. Details of the results are explained in the following subsections.

Table 2. Network structure of the forums. Here, ACC = Avg. Clustering Coeff. and LCC = Largest
Connected Component. The # communities column shows the number of communities with the
number of trivial communities with less than 4 members are shown in parentheses. We found that
as forums get larger, the number of large communities decreases.

BlackhatWorld: On BlackhatWorld, 1620 members, out of 8718, participated in private
message interaction. The Louvain method discovers 22 communities with modularity
score 0.46. 18 of the communities have at least 4 members. The largest community in
BlackhatWorld has 212 members. All the communities have similar structures: two-tier
organization with a few central members and the majority of the members are connected
to the central members. Every community has some special topics, for example, com-
munity 1 trades tools for automatic video uploading and CAPTCHA solving (Table 3).

Carders: On Carders, we found 27 communities with 0.29 modularity, out of which
14 communities have more than 100 members. Our result shows that smaller commu-
nities tend to have one central node and show a two-tier hierarchy (Appendix A). The

largest community with 800 members has several central members instead of just one.
The topics of this community are more varied than the other communities. These topics
include selling Apple products (iPhone, iPad, macbook), crypting services and drugs,
for example, MDMA. Other communities have their own specialized topics. For ex-
ample, community 10 trades VPN services and handheld devices like Wii and iPod.
Interestingly, although many communities sell similar types of products like drugs and
accounts, there are differences in the actual product being traded, for example, commu-
nity 1 sells ephedrone (ephe) and diazepam but community 5 sells Viagra.

L33tCrew: On L33tCrew, 7687 members participated in private message interactions.
The Louvain method found 24 communities with modularity score 0.28, out of which 8
communities had at least 4 members. Communities in L33tCrew are much larger than
BlackhatWorld and Carders. Some communities specialize in speciﬁc topics (Table 3),
for example community 1 trades cardable shops list (online stores that accept stolen
cards), stealer (malware for stealing accounts) and fake packstation.

3.2 Analysis 2: Identifying central members
Centrality measures enumerate distinct properties, i.e. each measure represents a sep-
arate notion of the node’s importance in the network. The degree centrality of a node

indicates the total number of edges that connect it to other nodes. Degree central cy-
bercriminals exude higher trust to peers [23] and receive higher responses to public
posts [26]. Betweenness centrality enumerates the number of shortest paths that pass
through a node. On IRC chat rooms, individuals with high betweenness centrality have
access to more information both quantitatively and in terms of diversity [7]. Finally,
closeness centrality indicates how far a node is from every other node in the network.
High closeness centrality may lower transaction costs by reducing the number of overall
transactions for a speciﬁc cybercriminal [25]. These centrality measures examine direct
connections. Eigenvector centrality indicates the importance of indirect connections by
examining both the popularity of a node and the popularity of their connections [5].
Criminals with high eigenvector centrality may indicate leaders high [5]. If centrality
measures correlate it would indicate that the same criminals that exude higher trust also
enjoy other advantages such as lower cost and access to higher quality information.

Methodology: We use Networkx [14] to compute six centrality measures (CM) on the
social networks of the forums: degree (D), in degree (ID), out degree (OD), closeness
(C), betweenness (B), and eigenvector centrality (E). We calculated the correlations be-
tween the various centrality measures for all three forums using SciPy statistics pack-
age [19] and report the Spearman’s ρ in Table 5.

where 1 indicates perfect positive correlation. Here E = Eigenvector, C = Closeness, B = Be-
tweenness, ID = In-degree, OD = Out-degree, and D = Degree centrality. On BlackhatWorld
all the centrality measures are positively correlated which means that some cybercriminals were
simultaneously popular (degree), closer to other nodes (closeness), connected to other popular
criminals (eigenvector) and had a higher proportion of shortest path going through them (be-
tweenness). On Carders and L33tCrew, all but closeness centrality are positively correlated.

Results: Spearman’s ρ assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be
described using a monotonic function. All the correlations were statistically signiﬁcant
for p<0.001; however, the degree of correlation differs, as is evident from the ρ values
that range from 0.08 to 0.96. Thus, some cybercriminals were simultaneously popular
(degree), had a higher proportion of shortest path going through them (betweenness),
closer to other nodes (closeness), and connected to other popular criminals (eigenvec-
tor).

Centrally located criminals have competitive advantage, e.g. through better access
to market signals [7]. All four centrality measures were highly correlated across all fo-
rums. In addition the distribution of centrality was highly skewed, i.e. a few nodes had

high centrality, while most were peripheral. This indicates that a majority of cybercrim-
inals may receive a lower volume of responses to their posts [26], ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
collaborate with the most technically adept cybercriminals [11] and have less access to
quality information [7]. Thus, they are likely to be ripped off, with a handful of centrally
located individuals who enjoy high proﬁts and low transaction costs.

3.3 Analysis 3: Impact of enforcement

Underground forums are policed by moderators and admins who enforce forum rules
by issuing warnings and banning users when these rules are violated. For example,
users can be banned for spamming or having multiple accounts [26]. It is unclear if
banning users has any impact on the functioning of the network, positive or negative.
It has been noted that joining these forums is free [2] and cybercriminals often have
duplicate accounts [1], in fact having duplicate accounts is the most frequent reason for
individuals being banned [26]. After getting banned, banned users either simply rejoin
the forum or use a potentially undetected duplicate account. Here we investigate the
change in network topology when misbehaving nodes are removed and contrast it with
the change witnessed due to the regular churn of users in the forum.

Methodology: For each banned user ui, we calculate the corresponding node central-
ity, speciﬁcally betweenness, closeness, degree and eigenvector. Since the success of
a network often corresponds with the small world characteristics [2, 31], we exam-
ine the change in average clustering coefﬁcient (ACC) and average path length (APL)
respectively; for disconnected graphs we consider the APL of the largest connected
component. For each user ui we construct two graphs Gib and Gia: Gib from all of
the private messages sent between all users in the 30 days before ui was banned and
a graph Gia from all of the private messages sent between all users in the 30 days af-
ter ui was banned. When multiple users are banned in the same time period we model
them as one node. Thus, all the messages to and from all banned nodes are assigned
to one node entity. If one banned node sends a message to another node banned in the
same period, it would manifest as a loop in our graph. We calculate the centrality scores
for ui on Gib; we also compute ACC and APL on both Gib and Gia. ∆ACC is given
by ACCia-ACCib and ∆APL by AP Lia − AP Lib. We compute the correlations be-
tween network metrics, ∆ACC and ∆APL, and centrality measures to examine whether
removing more central offenders has a higher impact.

Finally, ∆ ACC and ∆ APL should be signiﬁcantly different when users are banned
as compared to the change observed due to periodic churn in the underground forum.
We partition the graph data into 30 day snapshots for the entire duration of the dataset.
We compute the change in ACC and APL for these snapshots to get a vector of ∆ACCr
and ∆AP Lr. We use Wilcoxon Test, a non-parametric test to compare the difference
in means, to contrast the difference between ∆ACC and ∆ACCr as well as ∆AP L
and∆AP Lr. The analysis is conducted using Networkx and R.

Results: We calculated the correlations between small world metrics, ∆ACC and ∆APL,
and the various centrality measures (the Spearman’s ρ is reported in Table 6). In gen-
eral the results for BlackhatWorld and L33tCrew are not signiﬁcant. This may be the

result of fewer data points for those forums compared to Carders. BlackhatWorld only
banned 43 members overall, while all the banning on L33tCrew happened in the last
three months of its operational lifetime. For Carders, which banned 22% of its mem-
bers, betweenness as well as closeness centrality correlated with small world character-
istics (p < 0.05). Thus, banning individuals who can propagate information over shorter
paths may be better for reducing trust in the network. From a deterrence perspective a
potential solution for law enforcement is to hijack the accounts of cybercriminals with
higher closeness/betweenness centrality to spread noise on the forum.

We compared the mean values for ∆ACC and ∆APL, for when users get banned
vs. the regular churn in the network. The change in small world characteristics for all
forums were the same for banned members as for the regular churn (p-value >> 0.05).
Thus, it appears that individuals currently being banned are not close to other nodes.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper we examine and evaluate the ‘organization’ of cybercriminals as it man-
ifests on underground forums. Research on cybercrime often presupposes organiza-
tion [24]. The nature and purpose of this organization, however, is seldom examined.

We noted the presence of distinct communities despite the focused nature of the fo-
rums. We found that smaller communities organize in a two-tier hierarchy akin to a gang
and are limited in size to Dunbar number; larger communities can have thousands of
members, manifest a multi-tiered complex hierarchy, and specialize in a more diverse
portfolio of cybercrimes compared to smaller cohorts. We observed that some cyber-
criminals simultaneously had lower transaction costs, access to better information, and
higher visibility in the network. Then it is likely that if law enforcement targets only
the central members, it would both lower the overall proﬁts and reduce trust within the
carding community. Finally, we found that the impact of banning misbehaving cyber-
criminals is similar that of the periodic churn of the forum.

There are obvious limitations of this research in terms of generalization. The dif-
ferences noticed between BlackhatWorld and the German carding forums might be an
effect of localization. Future efforts need to repeat these analyses on additional data
sets of both specialized forums dedicated to speciﬁc topics and other general purpose
underground forums. It is also important to examine the temporal development of trust
and organization in these communities. Finally, given trust is a key element for the sta-
bility of the forums, it would be illuminating to investigate the strategic creation and
positioning of fraudulent sybils to target the sustainability of these forums.
