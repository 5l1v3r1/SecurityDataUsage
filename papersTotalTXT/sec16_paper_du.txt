Introduction

Blackhat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has been
widely used to promote spam or malicious web sites.
Traditional blackhat SEO campaigns often target hot
keywords and establish link networks by spamming pop-
ular forums or compromising vulnerable sites. However,
such SEO campaigns are actively disrupted by search en-
gines providers, making the operational cost much higher
in recent years.
In this paper, we reveal a new type
of blackhat SEO infrastructure (called “spider pool”)
which seeks a different operational model. The owners
of spider pools use cheap domains with low PR (PageR-
ank) values to construct link networks and poison long-
tail keywords. To get better rankings of their promoted
content, the owners have to reduce the indexing laten-
cies by search engines. To this end, they abuse wildcard
DNS to create virtually inﬁnite sites and construct com-
plicated loop structure to force search-engine crawlers to
visit them relentlessly.

We carried out a comprehensive study to understand
this emerging threat. As a starting point, we inﬁltrated
a spider pool service and built a detection system to ex-
plore all the recruited SEO domains to learn how they
were orchestrated. Exploiting the unique features of the
spider pool, we developed a scanner which examined
over 13 million domains under 22 TLDs/SLDs and dis-
covered over 458K SEO domains. Finally, we measured
the spider-pool ecosystem on top of these domains and
analyzed the crawling results from 21 spider pools. The
measurement result reveals their infrastructure features,
customer categories and impact on search engines. We
hope our study could inspire new mitigation methods and
improve the ranking or indexing metrics from search en-
gines.

To most people, search engine is the entrance to all sorts
of web sites on internet. The trafﬁc volume generated
through search engines is huge: the number one search
engine Google receives 3.5 billion search queries per
day [46] and the subsequent visits referred by the search
results can account for more than 60% of the incoming
trafﬁc of a website [55]. Improving sites’ search rank-
ings and attracting crawlers to visit them frequently are
very important to their owners.

Site owners and researchers have done extensive stud-
ies and come up with a set of “golden rules” on how to
improve one site’s performance in search results, which
are also called Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tech-
niques. Some SEO techniques aim to improve the site
structure (e.g., providing navigation in HTML pages)
and search afﬁnity (e.g., adding descriptive keywords
to titles and metadata). They are termed “whitehat
SEO” techniques and are encouraged by search engine
providers. However, applying these techniques usually
requires great effort from site owners and the effects are
not always immediate. As a shortcut, “blackhat SEO”
techniques are developed, which exploit the blind side of
search-engine algorithms and gain a site big advantage
in search results at low cost.

Traditional blackhat SEO practices recommend stuff-
ing keywords and injecting inbound links into reputable
sites. While the ﬁrst method can be achieved just by
manipulating the site’s content, the second one is much
more difﬁcult because it requires changing content on
other reputable sites which are not under SEOer’s con-
trol. Common approaches towards this goal include post-
ing spam links in forums [43], compromising sites to
inject links [24, 51], buying links from link exchange
services [54], and constructing link network using ex-

pired domains with high PR (PageRank) value [15, 16].
These techniques, nevertheless, require big investment
(e.g., buying links and expired domains) and could result
in severe penalties from search engines (e.g., when the
SEOer is found to use compromised sites).
New blackhat SEO techniques.
Instead of contest-
ing high rankings of trending keywords which are of-
ten dominated by top-brand sites, SEOers start to tar-
get the search queries containing long-tail keywords and
tunnel the trafﬁc to their sites [32]. Long-tail keywords
are usually overlooked by big sites because the trafﬁc to-
wards each keyword is quite limited. However, the traf-
ﬁc combined from many such keywords can be substan-
tial, which motivates SEOers to launch campaigns target-
ing them. The sites competing long-tail keywords usu-
ally have low PR value, leading to infrequent visits from
search-engine crawlers and long waiting time before be-
ing indexed (i.e., site is shown in search results) [18].
To increase the chance of being crawled, new blackhat
SEO strategy is proposed to feed inﬁnite hyperlinks to
crawlers which all point to the sites under SEOer’s con-
trol. When a crawler enters SEOer’s network, it will be
trapped and keep crawling the content fed by the SEOer.
To escape from such network, a crawler can check if it
keeps visiting a ﬁxed set of sites and exit when this hap-
pens. This is actually enforced by many search engines.
As a countermeasure, SEOers can create a massive num-
ber of fresh sites for the crawlers to foil the check, and
it turns out wildcard DNS perfectly serves this purpose.
A site with wildcard DNS toggled on can redirect vis-
its landing on its subdomains (e.g., aaaa.example.com)
to itself (e.g., example.com). Leveraging this tech-
nique, SEOers can create unlimited number of virtual
sites under only one valid domain name. This new attack
clearly harms search engines, as the crawling resources
are wasted and search results are manipulated.

This novel approach quickly gains popularity in the
blackhat SEO community, especially in China. The in-
frastructure built upon wildcard DNS domains is called
spider pool in China (“∎V” in Kanji) 1 and has been
broadly discussed in underground forums. In this study,
we aim to provide the ﬁrst comprehensive study of this
new threat in hopes of inspiring new methods for mitiga-
tion.
Our study. In order to understand the spider-pool infras-
tructure, we reached out to an owner of a spider pool in
operation and purchased SEO service to promote a site
created by us. Playing as a customer enabled us to in-
ﬁltrate the spider pool and discover unique features re-
garding its infrastructure. In particular, we found wild-
card DNS was extensively used on each site and dynamic

1Such infrastructure may be named differently in SEO communities
of other countries. We use spider pool to represent all variations for
brevity.

content generation was fully automated. We also discov-
ered a new promotion technique which has never been
reported by previous research. The adversaries are able
to advertise their messages through very popular sites,
like amazon.com, without compromising or even spam-
ming them.

Exploiting the DNS and content features of spider
pool, we developed a scanner based on DNS probing and
differential analysis. We used this scanner to examine
13.5 million domains under 22 TLDs and SLDs. The
result is quite alarming: we identiﬁed 458K spider pool
domains distributed among 19 TLDs/SLDs. In addition,
we discovered a trend of misusing new gTLD domains
for this type of SEO and also policy holes for domain
registration process of .ac.cn SLD. We measured these
domains in different aspects and show statistics regard-
ing their hosted IPs, domain registrars and registrants.
We found that though the domains are spread over 28K
IPs, they are rather centralized on a small set of ASNs,
registrars and controlled by a small group of SEOers.

Finally, we extended our study and crawled 20 new
spider pools using seed domains detected by our scan-
ner, to study their business model and impact on search
engines. As a result, we identiﬁed 15.8K SEO do-
mains, 1.4K customer domains and 7.2M URLs embed-
ding customer messages. The study on the business
model revealed new categories of customer’s business
that are never reported before. Our results also suggest
that spider pool is clearly effective in attracting search
crawlers and manipulating search results under long-tail
keywords. Baidu, the top search engine vendor in China,
has acknowledged our ﬁndings and we are now collab-
orating with Baidu to deploy detection system to purify
search results and capture spider pool services.
2 Background
In this section, we ﬁrst overview the factors affecting
search rankings and indexing delay of a website. Then,
we survey widely used blackhat SEO techniques and
their infrastructures which aim to promote a website’s
ranking unethically.
2.1 Search Engine Optimization
The goal of search engine is to provide a user with
a list of web pages that are relevant to search key-
words and ranked by their importance. Although rank-
ing algorithm is considered as the topmost secret by
search engine providers and is never released, guide-
lines and techniques called Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) are developed from white-papers published by
the providers, extensive experiments and reverse engi-
neering [17, 20, 44]. Whitehat SEO advocates improv-
ing the structure of a site to make it more friendly to
search crawlers. Advices include adding targeted key-

words to webpage (document body, title, meta tags and
page URLs), creating navigation page (e.g., a sitemap
ﬁle) to guide crawler, avoiding repeated page content,
and frequent content update. Improving the site’s quality
also increases the chance of being referred by other web
sites, which in turn increases its PR (PageRank) value.

In addition to gaining high rankings in relevant search
results, it is also important to reduce the indexing delay
of a page. The more frequently a web site is visited by
search crawler, the faster its pages will be indexed (i.e.,
shown in search results). The visit frequency is mainly
determined by the PR value [18], meaning that a new
web site might have to wait for a long time to be indexed
and displayed under search terms it targets.

While most of the web sites attempt to get good rank-
ings under hot keywords, the cost is always high. Instead,
targeting long-tail keywords might help the site harvest a
large volume of trafﬁc without big spending [32]. As
an example, to get top ranking under the search results
of “socks” is challenging, but achieving so for “socks
with dogs on them” or “socks that knock my socks off”
is much easier. In fact, the trafﬁc querying long-tail key-
words can account for 70% of all trafﬁc to a search en-
gine [10]. So, long-tail keywords are also important for
web sites.
2.2 Blackhat SEO Techniques
Tuning the factors that improve site’s quality is allowed
by search engine companies. However, unethical adver-
saries also develop techniques (i.e., Blackhat SEO) to
gain advantages in search results at low cost by gaming
ranking algorithms. We describe known techniques as
follows:
Content spam. Since the number of keywords con-
tained in a web page and URLs play an important role
in computing the ranking score, an adversary can either
repeat the same keywords to increase the relevance to
search terms of the same category, or include a spectrum
of trending keywords to associate the site with many
search terms of different categories (also named search
poisoning [31]). Recently, Google starts to penalize web
pages with excessively repeated contents, which forces
the SEOers to use a new technique called spinning to
generate spam texts with similar meaning but different
appearances [57]. A set of SEO toolkit is developed to
automate this process, like XRumer [6].
Link farm. To accumulate a large number of incom-
ing links to a web site, an adversary can set up link
farm [8, 53] which exploits the vulnerabilities of other
reputable sites to inject link. We show more details about
this blackhat SEO infrastructure in Section 2.3.
Cloaking. Blackhat SEO is becoming one popular chan-
nel for malware and scam delivery. Cloaking technique
is leveraged to serve benign content to search engines

while malicious content to normal visitors, in order to
avoid being detected [50]. User agent, referrer ﬁeld in
HTTP header, and IP address are inspected to determine
if the request is from a real browser or a search engine
crawler.
2.3 Blackhat SEO Infrastructures
The number and quality of incoming links are key factors
for the effectiveness of a SEO campaign. The adversary
needs to have a large number of incoming links at dis-
posal to elevate the site’s popularity. Different blackhat
SEO infrastructures on organizing the links have been
discovered and they are described below.
Forum spam. Web forum accepts and displays posts
contributed by web users, and the posts are also crawled
by search engines. A forum with high reputation is prone
to be abused by attackers who post links to promote their
sites [37]. Moreover, blog sites allowing comments are
also likely to be spammed by the similar techniques. As
a mitigation strategy, a site can set the rel attribute of
external links as nofollow to stop disseminating repu-
tation score to spam links [20], or request CAPTCHA
solving before comments are posted.
SEO botnet. The adversary has limited privileges in
posting spams to forum/blog. To overcome such restric-
tions, attackers could choose to compromise vulnerable
sites, turn them into botnet, and make them refer to the
sites to be promoted. Later, when search engines visit
the compromised sites and compute rank value, the pro-
moted web site will get an unusual high ranking [24,51].
Some SEO kits are developed to manage thousands of
sites simultaneously, reducing attackers’ workload [2].
Knowing the existence of such infrastructure, search en-
gine vendors are actively detecting compromised sites
and removing sites promoted in this fashion. The com-
promised sites are also alarmed in search results to avoid
being clicked by victim visitors [49].
Link exchange platform. There are also online fo-
rums and platforms helping website administrators to
exchange incoming links and improve their sites’ rank
mutually [54]. Examples include sape.ru [39] and
warriorforum.com [52]. Link exchange through SEO
forum and platform is explicitly forbidden by search en-
gine companies like Google, which for example penal-
izes buyers of sape.ru [40]. This approach is also ex-
pensive for adversaries, because they have to buy links to
maintain their faked popularity.
Private Blog Network (PBN). This is a new type of
black SEO infrastructure. The adversaries ﬁrst buy and
set up many blog sites on a set of expired domains with
high PR values, then construct link network carefully un-
der their control, and ﬁnally inject outgoing links point-
ing to sites to be promoted [15, 16]. Expired domains

with high PR values are usually sold at high prices, so
a large-scale and successful PBN could cost consider-
ably [11].
3 Dissecting a Spider Pool Campaign
Since search engine vendors upgrade their ranking al-
gorithm frequently (e.g., Google updates its algorithm
500-600 times per year [42]) and demote sites engaged
in blackhat SEO actively or even seize the back-end
servers [49], attackers are forced to invent new ways to
keep their business effective and proﬁtable. In this sec-
tion, we elaborate our study on “spider pool”, a new type
of blackhat SEO infrastructure unreported by previous
research.
3.1 Overview
All known blackhat SEO techniques ask for massive in-
coming links from reputable sites to increase the impor-
tance score of the promoted site under hot keywords,
which are always competed by numerous sites.
In-
evitably, these techniques are very expensive. To reduce
the cost, SEOers start to operationalize their campaigns
under long-tail keywords, for which the competition is
more relaxing. Though the search trafﬁc ﬂowing to an
individual long-tail keyword is nominal, the volume ac-
cumulated for a large set is considerable.

Furthermore, new or expiring domains which are
much cheaper are recruited to set up this SEO infrastruc-
ture. However, since the PR values of these domains are
usually negligible, they cannot be directly used to boost
the score of the customer sites they point to. This causes
a big issue in indexing latency, as search engines prefer
to crawl and index a page faster if it comes from sites
with high PR value.

Instead of sitting and waiting for the search crawler
to knock on the door, spider pool actively traps search
crawlers.
In other words, it keeps the crawlers visit-
ing sites (sites of both SEOer and customers) within the
border of attacker’s network.
How to trap a crawler. One intuitional approach to trap
crawler is through link loop, but search engines have al-
ready adopted some algorithms to detect loops that are
constructed intentionally. To evade detection, spider pool
applies techniques including creation of massive subdo-
mains and generation of dynamic contents. By adding a
wildcard DNS record (as shown in Figure 1) to the au-
thoritative DNS server, an adversary can conﬁgure the
web server to feed the crawler whatever subdomain she
wants to be visited (e.g., a.example.com). The web
page fed into the crawler is stuffed with spam links,
which instruct the crawler to visit other subdomains (e.g.,
b.example.com). In case the crawler skips the pages
with the same content, the site could render page dynami-
cally and provide distinctive content for each visit. Since

Figure 1: An example of wildcard DNS record.

the crawler always gets a “valid” page from a “valid”
website, it will follow the spam links and keep visiting
sites under adversaries’ control.
Effects. The major beneﬁt through using spider pool
is the boost of visiting frequency from search crawler,
given that there are always new pages fed into them. It
can also improve the importance score of the customers’
sites, as the incoming links from spider pool are mas-
sive.
In addition, the number of indexed pages under
customers’ sites can be increased as well.
Comparison with other SEO infrastructures. The
price of buying new or expiring domain is much cheaper
nowadays. As shown in domcomp.com, a web site list-
ing domain prices, one can purchase a domain for only
$0.99 at some registrars [13]. This is a big advantage
over PBN asking for expensive expired domains with
high PR value, and over link exchange service for expen-
sive links. In the meantime, attackers can easily change
the underlying link structure, which outperforms forum
spam in ﬂexibility. Moreover, since the sites in spider
pool are not compromised, they are less likely to be de-
tected and alarmed compared to sites recruited by SEO
botnet, as shown in Section 5.2.
Terms. For simplicity, throughout this paper, we use do-
main to refer to the domain name purchased by the adver-
sary, which is different from hostname or FQDN that can
be created randomly at her will through wildcard DNS.
We call domains controlled by the spider pool owner
SEO domains and pages with spam links SEO pages. The
parties who use spider pool to promote their sites or mes-
sages (explained at the end of this section) are called cus-
tomers.
3.2
To better understand the business model, features and op-
erational details of a spider pool, we inﬁltrated one popu-
lar spider pool service provider called super spider pool2.
In this paper we use SSP to refer to this service. Differ-
ent from dedicated spider pool which is built for a single
customer, this is a shared spider pool which sells SEO
service to customers publicly. It adds the URL provided
by customers to its SEO pages after payment.
Purchasing spider pool service. We bought a domain 3
and set up a web site with fake contents generated from

wildcard DNS to breed unlimited numbers of subdomains (e.g., jftxy.27sb.cn). Subdomains under different domains are inter-
connected and the links are dynamically generated. When a search crawler approaches one subdomain, it will be trapped in the
spider pool until being released to customers’ sites or URLs bearing customers’ messages.

pages were modiﬁed to ensure there is no input box
that accepts user’s sensitive information (e.g., credit card
number) when a real user accidentally visits our site.
Server logging functions were turned on to record infor-
mation of incoming requests like time, user agent, IP ad-
dress, and etc. We ﬁltered out logs that do not belong to
search crawlers using user agent patterns. Then, we reg-
istered an account in SSP, uploaded the homepage link
, and started an advertising campaign of 14 days (from
Nov 1st, 2015 to Nov 14th, 2015) for our testing web
site.

Exploring spider pool infrastructure. Several days af-
ter starting our campaign, we searched the URL of our
site in Google. The results are shown in Figure 3. Our
URL was listed in the results, together with URLs of
SEO pages set up by the spider pool. This ﬁnding mo-
tivates us to explore the whole spider pool infrastructure
by iteratively sending queries to Google, which neverthe-
less turns out to be very time-consuming, as described
in Appendix A. Therefore, we start to explore the in-
frastructure through other means. As discussed in Sec-
tion 2.1, well-structured web site (e.g., a site providing
sitemap ﬁle) can be visited by crawlers frequently and
indexed timely. We sampled several SEO domains and
found this was also followed by SSP: a sitemap.html
ﬁle was put under the root directory of every SEO do-
main to instruct the crawler to ﬁnd other SEO or cus-
tomer domains. An example of the sitemap ﬁle is shown
in Figure 4. This feature motivates us to build a dedicated
crawler which follows sitemap ﬁle to excavate sites be-
longing to SSP.

First, we feed a previously discovered SEO domain as
a seed into Q (the queue of domains to be searched). Our
crawler starts from requesting the sitemap.html under
root folder and extracts all the links inside <a href>
tags. The domains of the links which have not been vis-
ited will be appended to Q. The sitemap ﬁle is refreshed
twice, to include domains added dynamically by the SEO
toolkit. The crawler then visits the next domain in Q,
checking if the domain is a SEO domain and extracting
all other domain names, until there is no more domain
left. With this approach, we are able to harvest a large
number of domains in SSP under moderate time.

3.3 Features of Spider Pool
The preliminary exploration offers us a partial view of
SSP, and we manually examined the domains included
by SSP (we demonstrate how to automatically classify
the domains in Section 3.4). In particular, we select the
domains used for SEO and present the interesting ﬁnd-
ings below:
Wildcard DNS usage. As expected, wildcard DNS
plays an important role in spider pool and greatly im-
proves its scalability: the total number of SEO FQDNs
is up to 44,054 but the number of SEO domains is only
514 5. In other words, the size of the spider pool is in-
ﬂated 86 times through this technique. We also ﬁnd that
DGA (Domain generation algorithm) is incorporated in
domain generation: most of the fabricated subdomain
names are 5-10 characters ﬁlled with random letters and
digits (see domain names in Figure 2).
Content generation. The effects of wildcard DNS on
SEO have been discussed by SEO community. In fact,
replicating same pages under different subdomains will
delay the indexing of legitimate content as Google con-
siders the crawl budget is wasted on these site [14, 33].
However, if pages on subdomains are all distinctive, the
site would not be penalized [3]. Therefore, spider pool
site dynamically renders page content for each visit.

To understand how the content is generated, we in-
spected a copy of spider pool toolkit shared for free on
a public cloud drive 6. The SEO pages generated by this
toolkit resembles the SEO pages of SSP.
In fact, the
toolkit includes a dictionary of long-tail keywords and
text scraped from trending ﬁctions, and randomly assem-
bles keywords and sentences to construct the SEO pages.
To make the page look more legitimate, the toolkit em-

beds images from the local storage. Another interesting
discovery is that cloaking technique is not used, so the
same contents are presented to both search crawlers and
normal browsers. We veriﬁed that by manipulating the
user-agent string of our crawler. Figure 5 shows an ex-
ample of the SEO page.
Link structure. Each spider pool site provides a sitemap
page (sitemap.html) to direct search crawler to visit
other sites according to its intention. By connecting
the discovered spider pool domains under linking rela-
tions, we ﬁnd that a strongly connected graph can be con-
structed in which there exists a route from any domain to
another. In addition, most of the links on a SEO page are
swapped per visit. To a search crawler, such link struc-
ture looks like an ever-changing labyrinth: every step the
crawler makes refreshes the whole link topology, so the
crawler is always trapped till arriving at customer’s site.
Leveraging this design, the customer’s site connected to
the spider pool can be indexed much faster and updates
on the site can be timely reﬂected in search results. For
a site running illegal business, such feature is quite ben-

eﬁcial as it allows the site to appear quickly in search
results before being taken down.

Domains controlled by adversary are limited and a
search crawler can realize when it is trapped by checking
if it keeps visiting the same set of domains. However,
due to wildcard-DNS techniques, loop detection is much
more difﬁcult as a random FQDN can be easily generated
and inserted into the path at any time.
Site free-ride. We also discovered a new type of pro-
motion method developed to show customer’s message
in search result. This is achieved through crafting a
search URL under a popular site with message ﬁlled
in query string and injecting it into the spider pool.
Since some popular sites targeted by adversary display
the query string in their search result no matter whether
meaningful content is returned or not, the message em-
bedded in query string will be fed into search crawler.
Also due to the site’s high PR value, the indexing pro-
cess is much faster and message is more likely to ap-
pear in top of search results. As an example, we found
one Amazon search URL 7 in a SEO page which con-
tains a message for an illegal business (selling counter-
feit certiﬁcate) with contact information (QQ number,
one of the most popular instant messenger in China).
Querying with the relevant keywords (“certificate
for CET-4/6 qq” translated from Chinese) in Google
returns the customer’s message at the top spot of search
results (see Figure 6).

We call this SEO trick “site free-ride”, as the reputa-
tion of a popular site is abused by blackhat SEO while
that site is neither compromised nor spammed at all,
which makes detection rather difﬁcult. In Section 5.3,
we show many top sites are misused in this way.
3.4 Classifying Spider Pool Domains
Following the trail of sitemap, different types of domains
are encountered, including SEO domains, customer site
domains, domains abused for message promotion and
other innocent domains. Though they can be distin-
guished through manual investigation, such approach is
not scalable. Therefore, we developed a classiﬁer to dif-
ferentiate these cases automatically.

We started from identifying SEO domains. We found

that SEO domains are all powered by wildcard DNS. In
addition, the page content is changed per visit while the
content from other types of sites is much more stable.
Therefore, we limited the scope to wildcard DNS domain
and compare the sitemap ﬁles for two consecutive visits
to determine if the domain was a SEO domain.

A problem we need to address here is how to measure
the difference between two visits. We ﬁrst attempted
to measure the text difference between the two HTML
pages, but we encountered a large number of false pos-
itives caused by dynamic content, e.g., online advertise-
ments. We improve this method by considering the dif-
ference of only hyperlinks between two pages. To dis-
card small changes on URLs of hyperlinks customized to
visitors, we normalize the URLs by removing the query
parameters and values. Taking two pages PA and PB as
an example, assuming the set of unique hyperlink URLs
in PA and PB are HA and HB, we compute |HA−HB|
and
|HA|
|HA−HB|
respectively and then compare the maximum
value to a threshold MinH.
If the maximum value is
larger than MinH, the domain is labeled as a SEO do-
main. We set MinH to 20% based on the empirical tests
and it renders good accuracy.

|HB|

The above method worked well for exploring SSP. In
Section 5.2, we tested 20 other spider pools using the
same detector with small changes. We found the home-
page is also used to guide search crawlers by some spider
pools. Therefore, the homepage was also inspected by
the detector.

After picking out SEO domains, our tool classiﬁes the

remaining domains to the following three types:

• The sites abused for message promotion are iden-
tiﬁed ﬁrst by using the URL patterns related to
search queries. By inspecting a large corpus of
message URLs, we identify 45 URL patterns, like
/search/, and use them to match all remaining
URLs.

• Then, the innocent sites are identiﬁed by match-
ing their domain names with Alexa top 1M site list.
Though some of them may use spider pool, we be-
lieve the chance is small if they want to keep good
reputation.

• The sites remained are classiﬁed as customer sites.
Our detection mechanism only relies on the feature on
link structure and is robust against different templates
and languages used by SEO pages. To evade our de-
tector, the adversary could suppress the change rate of
the SEO page for each visit, which however will make
the link structure less dynamic and more likely to be de-
tected by search engines. Another evasion is to disable
wildcard DNS support on SEO domains. Although we

USENIX Association  

25th USENIX Security Symposium  251

have found some spider pools are beginning to apply this
change, the majority of the SEO domains are wildcard
DNS powered, suggesting the adversaries are not plan-
ning to give up the beneﬁts brought by wildcard DNS.

4 Detecting SEO Domains through DNS

Scanning

Motivated by the ﬁndings from inﬁltrating SSP, we im-
plemented a scanner aiming to discover and measure
SEO domains of spider pool from an internet-wide view.
Though the detector described in Section 3 is effective in
enumerating SEO domains of spider pool, it highly de-
pends on the seeded domains and the discovery is still
limited.
Instead, we launched large-scale DNS scan-
ning to identify wildcard DNS domains and crawled their
sitemaps and homepages. Then, we applied differential
analysis to detect SEO domains, using the heuristics de-
scribed in Section 3.4. The process is elaborated as fol-
lows.

4.1 Data Source
We cluster the SEO domains employed by SSP according
to their TLDs and SLDs and examine their popularity.
Unsurprisingly, a large number of domains are under old
generic TLD (gTLD) like .com and country-code TLD
(ccTLD) like .cn. Interestingly, we also found a notice-
able number of domains under new gTLDs [45] like .xyz
and generic SLDs like .com.cn [9]. In the end, we de-
cide to scan domains under all these categories described
above.

For each TLD or SLD under study, we attempt to gain
access to its DNS zone ﬁle ﬁrst. If zone ﬁle is not avail-
able, we resorted to the domain collection offered by
third party and passive DNS data source. For .com, we
downloaded zone ﬁle from Verisign in Dec 2015 through
its TLD Zone File Access Program [47]. The unique
count of domains is over 125 million and we sample
2 million (1.6%) for study. We also apply for the ac-
cess to zone ﬁles of new gTLDs and several old TLDs
through Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS) man-
aged by ICANN [23]. We obtained zone ﬁles from 10
registries for most popular new gTLDs in Dec 2015. The
.cn zone ﬁle was retrieved from viewdns.info [48] in
Dec 2015 (the zone ﬁle has over 5.5M domains, account-
ing for around 64% of all 8.6M .cn domains [12]). For
the remaining TLDs, we searched passive DNS database
provided by Farsight Security [41] and extracted do-
mains from all A records within 2015. The list of TLDs
and the statistics are shown in Table 1 8.

8We did not ﬁnd SEO domains under .gov, .edu, .edu.cn and

.gov.cn in SSP. They are only scanned for comparison.

4.2 Detection System
To detect wildcard domains, we implement a DNS scan-
ner to probe all domains (13.5 million) in our list. For
any name (e.g., a.com) in the list, our scanner issues
a wildcard A record query (*.a.com) to its authorita-
tive server directly, bypassing resolvers provided by local
ISP. If we get a valid IP (same as the one used by a.com),
we consider that the domain supports wildcard. To pre-
vent ISP’s DNS wildcard injection with its web portal’s
IP, we detect such behavior before our large scale prob-
ing, and ﬁlter out such IP address used by local ISP.

It is challenging to handle such large volume of do-
mains we collected. To optimize the performance, we
choose to issue DNS queries and process responses asyn-
chronously.
In particular, the scanner runs one thread
unremittingly issuing DNS requests in UDP and another
thread picking up matched DNS responses from incom-
ing trafﬁc. Our task was able to ﬁnish within 120 hours
and we report the result in Table 1.

We obtained 2.4 million wildcard domains (17.8% of
all scanned domains) after the scanning process and the
next step is to determine which domains are used for spi-
der pool. To this end, we use crawler to visit the sitemap
(or homepage when sitemap is not available) of the root
folder of each wildcard domain twice, then compare the
hyperlinks using the same heuristics described in Sec-
tion 3.4. The domains showing different set of hyper-
links are considered SEO domains. In the end, we cap-
tured 458K (19.1% of all wildcard DNS domains) such
domains in total. This result suggests an unnegligible
proportion of domains have conﬁgured wildcard DNS for
SEO purposes.

We further classify the detected SEO domains based
on how the pages are linked to customer’s content and
identify three different types. All of them can be gen-
erated from the templates of known spider pool toolk-
its [22]. We elaborate each type in Appendix B. The
number under each type is reported in #iframe, #link and
#redir columns in Table 1.
Veriﬁcation. Our detection system discovered a large
amount of SEO domains and we want to know how ac-
curate the outcome is. Counting the true positives among
them accurately is nearly impossible because there is no
off-the-shelf detection system we can use as the oracle
and it will take massive human efforts to examine all of
them. As an alternative, we sample 1,000 SEO domains
at maximum per TLD/SLD and evaluate them to estimate
the accuracy. We manually look into the title, page text
and link structure, and compare them with known SEO
pages from SSP. We consider one as true positive if these
features resemble. We ﬁnd the highest false-positive rate
(FPR) per TLD/SLD occurs on .com, which is 1.2%.
The main reason for the false positives is that many links

on the pages lead to the advertisements which are also
changing for each visit. We do not ﬁnd any false positive
under .ren, .link, .party and .click. The FPR for
all domains is 0.8%, suggesting that our detector is quite
effective.
4.3 Detection Result
As shown in Table 1, the number of wildcard DNS do-
mains and SEO domains distributes unevenly across dif-
ferent TLDs and SLDs. We elaborate our ﬁndings for old
TLDs, new gTLDs and generic SLDs separately below:
Old TLD. Among old TLDs open for general registra-
tion, including .cc, .pw, .com and .cn, we observe a
large number of wildcard DNS domains taking unneg-
ligible portion (ranging from 9% to 66%). The num-
ber of wildcard DNS domains abused for spider pool
is also large, consisting of more than 200K .cn , 30K
.com, 10K .cc and 40K .pw domains. The ratio of SEO
domains under .pw (17.7%) is much higher than other
TLDs. It is reported that .pw domains are extensively
used for email spam [38] and our result shows they are
also favored by SEOers. To the opposite, due to more
restricted controls, only a small ratio of .gov and .edu
domains 9 supports wildcard DNS and we have not found
any SEO domain among them.
New gTLD. Since ICANN launched the new gTLD pro-
gram in 2011, the TLD space has been expanded un-
precedentedly. There are more than 1,000 gTLDs rolled
out already, comparing to dozens of gTLDs before 2011.
The delegated registrars under these TLDs frequently

9The number of .edu and .gov domains we have collected is much
less than other TLDs, but our result is still meaningful, as it represents
49% and 22% domains known to the public [12].

promote their domain registration business through dis-
counts, which have attracted a large volume of registra-
tion [21]. For example, around 1.7 million domains have
been registered under .xyz. However, it was also re-
ported that some new gTLDs were ill-managed, lead-
ing to a large number of spam/malware domains regis-
tered [19]. Our research supports this ﬁnding to some
extent. We have identiﬁed 137K SEO domains already
and 8 out of 10 new gTLDs have seen more than 1K SEO
domains.
Generic SLD. Similar to TLDs, a generic SLD usually
represents domains used for the same general purpose or
is managed by a central institute. We have picked 3 out of
7 generic SLDs under .cn for study [9]. Similar to .gov
and .edu, domain registration and resell under .edu.cn
and .gov.cn are tightly controlled. We did not iden-
tify any spider pool domains under .edu.cn, but were
able to capture a small amount of SEO domains under
.gov.cn. It is nevertheless surprising to capture more
than 20K SEO domains (28.1%) under .ac.cn, which
represents the research institutes in China. The domain
registration is managed by Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) and Xinnet and the applicant must prove that she
represents a valid research institute. We speculate that
the registration policies are not fully enforced and urge
authorities to harden the registration process.

5 Measurement
As revealed from the large-scale DNS probing, the num-
ber of domains used for spider pool SEO is massive. In
this section, we ﬁrst measure the infrastructure charac-
teristics (i.e., IP and location distribution, domain regis-
trars and registrant distribution) to study how attackers’

resources are aligned. Then, to extend our understanding
on spider pool business model, we sample SEO domains
detected from DNS scanning and use 20 of them as seeds
to identify new spider pool campaigns. We show detailed
results regarding their customers and impact on search
engines. We elaborate our ﬁndings as follows.
5.1 SEO Domains
We ﬁrst evaluate how SEO domains are distributed
among spider pools’ hosting infrastructure and how they
are registered. Then we selected one spider pool SSP and
monitored the changes of its SEO domains for one month
to measure the dynamics.
IP distribution.
Our ﬁrst question is whether dis-
tributed hosting is a popular design choice, since such
a structure seems to be more resilient against adminis-
trative take-down actions. We issued DNS queries to
all 458,246 SEO domains described in Section 4.1 af-
ter they were detected. Except the domains that were
unresolvable to these queries, we obtained 28,443 IP ad-
dresses associated with 434,731 domains in total. Then,
we use the API provided by ip-api.com 10 to retrieve
their ASN (AS number) and country information. The
answer turns out to be positive, as over 28K IPs have
been identiﬁed and each IP hosted less than 16 domains
on average. But on the other hand, the adversaries prefer
to assign a large number of SEO domains to certain ASs
(autonomous systems), probably for the purpose of re-
ducing the management cost. We obtained ASNs for all
28K IPs and listed the top 10 ASNs sorted by the num-
ber of hosted domains in Table 2.
It shows that more
than 87.6% of all domains (381,041 out of all 434,731)
were hosted on these top 10 ASNs and the topmost ASN,
AS6939, hosted nearly 95K domains (21.7%).

Next, we look into geo-locations of the hosts, trying to
identify if adversaries prefer certain countries to run the
operations. It turns out that most of the domains (80.5%
over all 434,731 domains) and IP addresses (80.7% of
28,443 IPs) were hosted in United States, as shown in Ta-
ble 3. In contrast, only 4.5% domains are hosted within

China, though most of the spider pool campaigns we
have encountered were targeting markets in China. The
reason for this arrangement, we speculate, is to avoid
interventions from local governments including server
take-downs and seizures.
Domain registration. Furthermore, we inspect the in-
formation regarding how the SEO domains are regis-
tered. We queried the TLD Whois servers for registrar,
registrant and registration dates about the 458,246 SEO
domains. In total, we were able to get valid Whois infor-
mation for 425,345 domains. We describe our ﬁndings
below.

Similar to the distribution on ASNs, most of the
SEO domains are offered by a small amount of regis-
trars. Table 4 lists the top 10 registrars that account for
81.8% SEO domains (out of 425,345 domains). Among
them, 21.0% domains were registered under Chengdu
West Dimension Digital Technology CO.. We
also found that a lot of SEO domains were owned by a
small number of registrants. As shown in Table 5, the top
10 registrants controlled 51.9% SEO domains (220,854
out of 425,345). Perhaps even more interesting is that a
lot of registrants in deed provide email addresses instead
of leaving them blank or using private registration to hide
their identities. It is recommended by spider pool com-
munity to acquire new and expiring domains, which has
been conﬁrmed by our data. Figure 7 illustrates the num-
ber of all SEO domains registered per month. The oldest
domain we observed was registered in Jan 2014 and the
domain age is about 2 years. Peaks of registration activ-
ities were observed during Oct 2015 and Feb 2016, and
it turns out the spider pool owners tend to register them
in bulk and use them for the same campaigns. Since the
domains are disposable, most of them are only registered
for only 1 or 2 years.
Structure dynamics. The previous results indicate that
spider pool owners usually recruit many new and expir-
ing domains to build up their infrastructures. However,
it is not yet clear about their strategies in maintaining
the infrastructure, especially on how the infrastructure
is evolved. To answer this question, we monitored the
structural changes of SSP for 25 days within Jan 2016.
We use the same spider pool explorer described in Sec-
tion 3 to crawl SSP every day and store the discovered
SEO domains separately. Figure 8 illustrates the daily

numbers of all SEO domains and the newly recruited
domains that were not seen before. The structure was
relatively stable for the ﬁrst two weeks, but it started to
change drastically in the third week: the amount of SEO
domains climbed up quickly to 1,800 and then dropped
back to 600. By inspecting the registration information,
it turns out a large number of domains would expire dur-
ing that week. So in order to compensate the loss, a bulk
of new domains was purchased to replenish the spider
pool. As the result, the size of the spider pool bounced
back to 1,600 on the 25th day.
5.2 Statistics of Spider Pool Campaigns
The above measurement study shows an overall view of
SEO domains recruited for spider pool usage.
In this
subsection, we studied the structure of individual spi-
der pools, including SEO domains and customer do-
mains/URLs. Among all conﬁrmed SEO domains, we
sample one domain per TLD/SLD as seed and run the
same crawling method described in Section 3.2 to dis-
cover the infrastructure of the whole spider pool. For
certain TLD/SLD containing much more SEO domains,
like .cn and .ac.cn, we sample several other domains.
Each newly discovered spider pool is compared with pre-
vious ones. If the overlap of SEO domains is over 50%,
the spider pool is likely to have been explored and is dis-
carded therefore. Through this process, we harvested 20
independent spider pools and the statistics are shown in
Table 6 (labeled as S1 to S20). The result of SSP is also
included. In total, we have discovered 15,816 SEO do-

mains, 1,453 customer site domains, and 7,236,315 cus-
tomer search URLs from the crawling results of the total
21 spider pools.

In terms of the number of used SEO domains, we ﬁnd
it largely differs between spider pools, which varies from
100 to 1,933 and is averaged at 753. Regarding served
customers, some spider pools include a large amount of
search URLs: the maximum number for one spider pool
is 2.6M. Such result should be taken with a grain of salt,
since the URLs could be dynamically built for each visit
from our crawler. On the other hand, the maximum of
customer sites promoted by spider pool is only 710. We
ﬁnd that different spider pools tend to have big overlap
of customer sites. By looking into the popular spider
pool toolkit, we found that a lot of customer sites are
included by default. This can explain the big overlap
to some extent. Still, we ﬁnd several different types of
business (mostly illegal) leveraging spider pools for pro-
motion and we elaborate our study in Section 5.3.

We are also interested in how good the security com-
panies are at capturing the spider pool domains. To an-
swer this question, we scanned all 15,816 SEO domains
using VirusTotal in Feb 2016. Surprisingly, only 474 do-
mains (2.9%) were ﬂagged by at least one blacklist re-
cruited by VirusTotal. The reason could be that most
of SEO domains do not contain malicious content, like
drive-by-download code and phishing page, since their

main goal is only SEO.
5.3 Customers
We now extend our study to the customers who employ
spider pools to promote their business. We ﬁrst extract
customers’ sites referred by SEO pages and classify them
into different categories according to the business they
served. Also from the inﬁltration study on SSP, we dis-
cover that the adversary invent a new promotion tech-
nique which abuses the reputation of popular sites to
advertise her messages, and such message promotion is
also observed in other 20 spider pools as well. We are in-
terested in which sites are abused and how the messages
are composed, and we present our measurement results
below.
Customer sites characterization. We examine all the
crawled web pages from the 1,453 identiﬁed customer
sites, and cluster them through content analysis. Previous
works studying spam/scam campaigns [28, 50] looked
into the HTML DOM structure and grouped the pages
under the similar structure, on the premise that most
pages are built with a small set of templates. How-
ever, the pages we have analyzed here do not follow such
premise as the page structures are quite diverse. We ad-
dress this problem through a different way: we used the
well-established nature language processing (NLP) tech-
niques to parse the page’s abstract (including title, meta
keywords and meta description) into terms and identify
the topic model [4] based on the term frequency. We
leveraged an online document analysis service [5] to au-
tomate this process, which classiﬁes a document into one

of the topics pre-determined. Then, we manually exam-
ined the results and adjusted the topic when it is incor-
rect. The names of some topics were reﬁned to better
characterize the business as well. Through this proce-
dure, we were able to cluster 930 sites 11 into 7 topics.
Table 7 lists these topics and the number of correspond-
ing sites. We elaborate each topic in Appendix C.

Different from the results revealed by previous studies
on search poisoning [31], we do not ﬁnd any customer
site delivering malware or phishing content. Moreover,
we identiﬁed new types of business, other than stores
selling fake goods or pharmacies [28,34]. It turns out the
goals of the customers are mainly to promote their illegal
business without unveiling traces to local legal authori-
ties. As an example, surrogacy is banned in China [7] and
the agents behind cannot advertise their business through
well regulated channels like TV commercials. Therefore,
they spammed the search results using spider pool as an
alternative.
Customer message characterization. Starting from the
15K spider pool domains, we identiﬁed over 7.2M mes-
sage URLs free-riding reputable sites. The adversaries
tend to keep a pool of candidate sites and attach the mes-
sage to their search URLs randomly.
In Table 8, the
top 20 sites being abused are listed and the topmost site
serves 114K message URLs. All of these sites are listed
in Alexa top 1M, including highly reputable ones, like
amazon.com and ebay.com. For a search engine, these
message URLs should be removed, which however is not
a trivial task because valid search results about popu-
lar goods on sites like amazon.com are also included in
Google and should not be pruned.

We then look into the promoted messages. Most of
them are composed of a long-tail keyword (e.g., “where
to buy hallucinogen”) and contact (e.g., “the QQ of cus-
tomer service is: 90909090”). While the long-tail key-
word is readable, the contact number is usually obfus-
cated.
In particular, we saw “0” is replaced with “o”
(“9o9o9o9o”) and special symbol was inserted into the
number (“909-909-909”). We suspect such obfuscation

11The remaining 523 sites were not processed because their abstracts
were invalid, the sites were down when we crawled their homepages or
the clusters they belong to were small.

Impact on Search Engines

is used to evade detection of automated tools. Through
some manual efforts, we created rules which map the ob-
fuscated number to original one and were able to parse
about half of the 7.2M messages (3M). In the end, we
identiﬁed 23 QQ numbers accounting for 2.4M messages
which are all related to illegal services. The details of
these numbers are shown in Table 9 of Appendix D. We
think extracting the contact information is meaningful
for search engines or other departments. By tracing from
the contact information, the identities of the criminals
could be revealed, which can greatly facilitate criminal
investigation.
5.4
Spider pool is mainly used to increase the visiting fre-
quency from search crawlers and we evaluate its effec-
tiveness by examining the logs collected on our servers
used for inﬁltration study of SSP. In addition, we look
into how search results under long-tail keywords are ma-
nipulated.
Visit frequency from search engines. After 14 days,
the targeted search engines (Google, Baidu) began to in-
dex the homepage and other pages under our test site
(his-and-hers.xyz). To determine if the effects from
spider pool are consistent, we relaunched our testing
SEO campaign and added 2 additional sites 12 into SSP
after a pausing period. Statistics are plotted in Figure 9
for Google and Baidu respectively. As shown in both ﬁg-
ures, the effects are obvious: the average number of visits
per day jumped from 28 to 66 for Google and from 4.5
to 37.5 for Baidu during the campaign. Once the cam-

paign was stopped, the visit count dropped signiﬁcantly,
but restored quickly after the campaign was resumed.
Data from the other two sites show similar trends, which
proves the effectiveness of spider pool services.
Search results manipulation. To assess how search re-
sults are manipulated under keywords, especially long-
tail keywords, we sample 43 long-tail keywords under
4 categories discovered from customers’ messages and
query them on Google and Baidu. Then, we examine the
returned results from the ﬁrst page and look for wildcard
DNS domains in particular. If the search result associ-
ated with the wildcard DNS domain is ﬁlled with spam
texts, we consider it is manipulated by spider pool. In

the end, we ﬁnd spider pool compromised 27 keywords
in Google and 30 keywords in Baidu (see Table 10 of
Appendix E), indicating spider pool is quite effective and
widely used for poisoning long-tail keywords.
Interest-
ingly, the poisoned keywords show clear distinction be-
tween Google and Baidu under different categories: we
see keywords related to sex and medicine are more likely
to be poisoned in Baidu while for Google they are under
categories of ﬁrearms sales and fake certiﬁcate. Another
interesting ﬁnding is that adversary is able to manipulate
all search results (100%) under some keywords in Baidu,
especially under sex categories.

6 Discussion
Responsible disclosure and feedback. We have con-
tacted the security lab of Baidu and reported our ﬁnd-
ings and spider pool domains we discovered. Baidu ac-
knowledged our ﬁndings and is verifying our results. In
fact, Baidu is aware of the existence of spider pool, but
is surprised by the scale and the impact on search results.
To help Baidu clean the search results and mitigate the
threat, we applied the detection system to the indexed
URLs offered by Baidu and provide a report of spider
pool domains on a weekly basis.
Ethical issues. To understand the internal mechanisms
of spider pool, we paid the owner of SSP advertising fee
to include our sites into the SEO pages. This could raise
ethical concern as the criminal group was funded by us,
however, we argue that the inﬂuence was rather limited
as we ran the campaign for a small period and chose the
cheapest service category, costing only 8 dollars in total.
Another concern is that our inﬁltration experiment could
contribute to the pollution of search engine results. Yet,
we argue that the impact is still limited, as we intention-
ally chose hot keywords. Our sites were shown in search
results only when the user searched our URL directly. In
addition, we have closed the 3 test websites and informed
Google and Baidu via email to eliminate our URLs from
the search results after the study.
Limitations. We have designed and implemented a sys-
tem to detect SEO domains through DNS probing and
another system to explore the spider pool territory from
seed domains. However, if adversaries know these de-
tection algorithms, they can upgrade their infrastructures
for evasion. We discuss several evasion strategies in Sec-
tion 3.4. These strategies would increase the running cost
or reduce the effectiveness of spider pool without excep-
tion. Besides, as an initial step, our goal in this work is
to explore the landscape of this rising threat and measure
its impacts. A large volume of sites have been discov-
ered with the help of our systems and fulﬁlled the need
for measurement study. For the future work, we will in-
vestigate the feasible ways to improve the systems.

Recommendations to search engines. The search en-
gine can refrain from crawling and indexing pages under
SEO domains when the FQDNs are random and abun-
dant outbound links are embedded. However, extra ef-
forts should be taken to reduce the false positives. As
a matter of fact, it is also common that legitimate web
sites delegate subdomains to others, and they may exhibit
similar characteristics to SEO domains. We also suggest
search engines to keep a close watch on keywords, es-
pecially long-tail keywords, under certain topics. As de-
scribed in Section 5.4, spider pools tend to target limited
topics so their campaigns could be discovered by moni-
toring the associated long-tail keywords.
7 Related Works
Understanding blackhat SEO. The damage caused by
blackhat SEO has been known for a long time and there
have been a corpus of works studying this issue. One
line of such works focused on the infrastructure of black-
hat SEO campaigns and how they are managed. Wang
et al. [51] inﬁltrated an SEO botnet and showed it is
quite effective in poisoning the trending search terms,
given its small size though. John et al. [24] dissected
an SEO campaign which hosted SEO pages on compro-
mised servers. Also an interesting topic is about how the
adversary makes use of blackhat SEO. McCoy et al. [34]
and Levchenko et al. [28] revealed that blackhat SEO
have been employed extensively for online store sell-
ing fake products and pharmaceutical afﬁliate networks.
Leontiadis et al. [26] measured the search-redirection at-
tacks used for drug trade and the result suggests such at-
tacks could overwhelm legitimate sites in search results
and provide more trafﬁc than email spam to the store-
front sites. To ﬁght against these threats, search engines
have being taken active actions and the studies show the
countermeasures were effective to some extend but there
is still long way ahead to win the battle [27, 35, 49].
Detecting blackhat SEO. Inspired by the studies of
blackhat SEO campaigns, several detection approaches
have been proposed based on different features revealed
from known SEO attacks.
John et al. [24] leveraged
URL signatures to identify SEO pages from a dataset
of URLs provided by search engines. Lu et .al. [31]
detected search poisoning by inspecting the redirection
chains unfolded when visiting a search result. Zhang et
al. [56] presented an approach which is capable of detect-
ing compromised sites abused for search poisoning from
seed sites. The features related to cloaking behaviors of
SEO sites [50] and content spinning on SEO pages [57]
were exploited for detection as well.
Wildcard DNS. Wildcard DNS is a widely used to map
different hostnames to the same IP and save the admin-
istrators from maintaining many different records. The
security implications, however, are not thoroughly eval-

uated yet. The only relevant research we knew so far
measured the prevalence of wildcard DNS conﬁguration
and showed that it is broadly used by malicious sites [25].
Long-tail SEO Spam. Due to the intensive competi-
tion on hot keywords, many blackhat SEOers now start
to target long-tail keywords. Still, the understanding is
limited. So far, we only found one recent work study-
ing this topic and showed the cloud web hosting service
is abused for long-tail SEO spam [30]. Our study com-
plements the existing works by revealing a new strategy
from blackhat SEOers.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted the ﬁrst comprehensive in-
vestigation on a new type blackhat SEO technique called
“spider pool” which abuses wildcard DNS to tamper
long-tail keywords of search engines. Based on the un-
derstanding through inﬁltrating a shared spider pool ser-
vice, we developed a DNS prober which can identify the
SEO domains with high accuracy and efﬁciency, together
with a spider pool explorer which is able to excavate the
domains used by individual spider pool through seed ex-
pansion. Our results show that spider pool has become
a big threat to registrars, search engines and their users,
as more than 458K SEO domains have been discovered,
popular sites like amazon.com are abused to promote il-
legal messages, and long-tail keywords can be easily pol-
luted. We think this new threat should be mitigated and
call for the attention from the security community.

Appendix
A Seed Expansion through Google Search
We can start from our testing site, identify the ﬁrst layer
of parent sites S1 leading to it, and recursively identify
sites at upper layers Sn(n > 1), till there are no more new
sites discovered. We seek the help from Google Search
for this task and develop a C++ program which directs
Firefox to automatically search on Google. In essence,
it keeps a queue of domains to be searched, pops out
the ﬁrst URL and queries Google, extracts all search re-
sult URLs in top 10 pages, and saves the domains unvis-
ited into the queue. The process ends when the queue is
empty.

Though the spider pool sites could be detected, the
performance is poor and the process is hard to converge.
We ﬁnd there are two main reasons. First of all, it takes
quite some time for Google to respond to our web re-
quest, and CAPTCHA has to be solved occasionally.
Second, the returned search results usually include sites
not in spider pool, e.g., sites providing domain regis-
tration information and fake search engines which copy
search results from other search engines 13. Such irrel-
evant sites have to be excluded, otherwise the iterations
will be inaccurate and may not even converge, but using
straightforward ﬁltering metrics like domain ranking and
URL patterns are not effective through our testing.
B Classiﬁcations of SEO domains
We identiﬁed three types of methods of linking cus-
tomer’s content to SEO pages. They are listed below:

1. Through iframe. Instead of pointing to customer’s
site, the SEO page directly encloses the customer’s
page in an HTML iframe. It leverages JavaScript
API document.write to inject the iframe, which
occupies the whole screen when the user lands on
the site. It could accumulate more trafﬁc towards
customer’s site when visitors happen to land on
SEO page.

2. Through hyperlink. The hyperlink pointing to cus-
tomer’s site or containing customer’s message is
displayed in the SEO page. This type is also used in
SSP we inﬁltrated.

3. Through redirection. For this type, a visit to
SEO page using certain user-agent string (e.g.,
Opera browser) is immediately redirected to cus-
tomer’s site through HTTP 302 redirect.
In fact,
it uses JavaScript code to assign customer’s URL
to window.top.location.href and HTML meta
refresh tag to redirect visitor’s browser. Likewise,

13The purpose of setting up such fake search engines is not yet clear.

We suspect they are used for click fraud [29].

customer’s content can be directly pushed to visi-
tor’s browser.

C Topics of Customer Sites
The 930 customer sites are classiﬁed under 7 categories
below:

1. Sales and Services. We ﬁnd industrial equipments
and products, like elevator and seamless pipe, are
sold on the customers’ sites. Services of gray areas
are also provided, like private detective and empty
invoices.

2. Gambling. It includes sites for online casino and

sports betting.

5. Sex. Some of the sites host adult content like porn
video and photos, while others list contacts of afﬁl-
iated prostitutes or their agents.

6. Games. Online games developed by less known
companies are provided.
In addition, some sites
provide information about the unauthorized servers
for big-brand games, like The Legend of Mir [1],
which can be connected to play the same game for
free or less fees.

7. Hospitals and Drugs. We ﬁnd the sites in this cat-
egory introduce hospitals which do not have valid
licenses. Besides, illegal drugs, like hallucinogen,
are sold in some sites.

3. Surrogacy. The sites provide channels for infertile

parents to ﬁnd women willing to carry pregnancy.

4. News. The sites serve as news portals about local

events.

D Classiﬁcations on Customer Messages
We analyze customer messages, extract QQ numbers
from customer messages, and sort them by the number
of associated URLs. The result is shown in Table 9.
E Impact on Search Engines
We sampled 43 long-tail keywords extracted from the
SEO pages crawled from the 21 spider pools and search
them in Google and Baidu. The result is shown in Ta-
ble10. We count the percentage of search results showing
spider pool domains. If no search results are returned,
we write “no search result”.
If no spider domains are
presented in search results, we write “no keyword”.
